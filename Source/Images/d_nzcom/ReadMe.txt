===== NZCOM Disk for RomWBW =====

This disk is one of several ready-to-run disks provided with
RomWBW.  It contains NZ-COM, which is an implementation of the
Z-System.  You may also see NZ-COM referred to as ZCPR 3.4.  This is
a powerful replacement for CP/M 2.2 w/ full backward compatibility.

The disk is bootable as is (the operating system image is already
embedded in the system tracks) and can be launched from the RomWBW
Loader prompt.  See the Usage and Notes sections below for more
information on how NZ-COM is loaded.

The remainder of this document describes the usage and contents of
this disk.  It is highly recommended that you review the "RomWBW
User Guide.pdf" document found in the Doc directory of the
RomWBW Distribution.

The primary documentation for NZ-COM is the "NZCOM Users Manual.pdf"
document  contained in the Doc directory of the RomWBW distribution.
This document is a supplement to the primary documentation.  Additionally,
please review the file called RELEASE.NOT on this disk which contains
a variety of updates regarding the NZ-COM distribuition.

The starting point for the disk content was the final official release of
NZ-COM which is generally available on the Internet.  A minimal
system generation was done just sufficient to get NZ-COM to run under
RomWBW.  NZ-COM is extremely configurable and far more powerful than
DRI CP/M.  It is almost mandatory that you read the NZ-COM manual to
use the system effectively.

== Usage ==

NZCOM is not designed to load directly from the boot tracks of a
disk.  Instead, it expects to be loaded from an already running
OS.  This disk has been configured to boot using ZSDOS with a
PROFILE.SUB command file that automatically loads NZCOM.  So, NZCOM
will load completely without any intervention, but you may notice
that ZSDOS loads first, then ZSDOS loads NZCOM.  This is normal.

There is no DIR command.  Use SDZ or ZXD instead.

*** TODO: Date stamping ***

== Notes ==

NZCOM is distributed in an unconfigured state.  The following was
done to create a minimal ready-to-run setup for RomWBW:

  - Ran MKZCM and saved default configuration to NZCOM.ZCM and
    NZCOM.ENV.
  - Extract VT100 TCAP from Z3TCAP.LBR and saved it as TCAP.Z3T.
  - Created PROFILE.SUB to launch NZCOM at startup.
  - Created empty STARTZCM.COM.
  - TCSELECT.COM was removed because a later version is provided
    from the Z3 files.
  - Z3LOC.COM and LBREXT.COM were removed because more recent
    versions are provided from Common files.
  - Replaced ZRDOS with ZSDOS in NZCOM.LBR.  The standalone
    ZRDOS.ZRL and ZSDOS.ZRL files were saved.

The following additional customizations were also performed:

  - The following files from the original distribution were removed
    because newer versions are included:

    - COPY.COM
    - CRUNCH.COM
    - LBREXT.COM
    - TCSELECT.COM
    - UNCRUNCH.COM
    - Z3LOC.COM
    - ZCNFG.COM

== NZCOM Files ==

The following files came from the official NZCOM distribution.  These
are generally documented in the "NZCOM Users Manual.pdf" document in
the Doc directory of the RomWBW distribution.  Note that some of the
files included in the NZ-COM distribution are not listed below because
they have been superseded by more recent versions listed in other
sections below.  For example, TCSELECT is not listed here, but a more
recent version is included and documented in the General Purpose
Applications section below.

== Testing Applications (User Area 2) ==

User area 2 contains a variety of hardware testing applications.
These are generally user contributed and have no documentation.
Additionally, they are frequently not compatible with all RomWBW
hardware.  They are included here as a convenience.  If applicable,
your hardware documentation should refer to them and provide usage
instructions.

== Sample Tune Files (User Area 3) ==

User area 3 contains sample audio files that can be played using
the TUNE application.

== CP/NET 1.2 (User Area 4) ==

User area 4 contains a full implementation of the CP/NET 1.2
client provided by Doug Miller.  Please read the README.TXT file
in this user area for more information.

N.B., at a minimum, some of the files in this user area must be copied
to user area 0 for CP/NET to work properly.
