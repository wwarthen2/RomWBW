==== Borland Turbo Pascal Compiler v3.01A =====

Pascal is a general-purpose, high level programming language originally
designed by Professor Niklaus Wirth of the Technical University of Zurich,
Switzerland and named in honor of Blise Pascal, the famous French philosopher
and mathematician.

Turbo Pascal closely follows the definition of Standard Pascal as defined in
the Pascal User Manual and Report with a few minor differences.

The manual can be found in the Docs directory,
Turbo_Pascal_Version_3.0_Reference_Manual_1986.pdf
