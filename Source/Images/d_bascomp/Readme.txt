===== Microsoft Basic-80 Compiler v.5.30a =====

The Microsoft BASIC Compiler is a highly efficient programming tool that
converts BASIC programs from BASIC source code into machine code. This
provides much faster BASIC program execution than has previously been
possible. It can make programs run an average of 3 to 10 times faster than
programs run under BASIC-80. Compiled programs can be up to 30 times
faster than interpreted programs if maximum use of integer variables is
made.
