ZRC has no real ROM.  It has a single 2048K RAM chip.  There
are two startup modes supported by RomWBW.

The normal startup mode treats the first 512KB like ROM and the
remaining 1536KB as RAM.  The first 512KB (pseudo-ROM) must be preloaded
by the ZRC CF Loader.  This mode simulates a normal ROM-based RomWBW
startup.

The ROMless startup mode treats the entire 2048KB as RAM.  However, in
this mode, only the first 512KB of RAM is utilized.  This is because
the RAM Disk is seeded by the CF Loader which is currently constrained
to loading 512KB.  The entire 512KB of RAM (less the top 32KB) must be
preloaded by the ZRC CF Loader.  There will be no ROM disk available
under RomWBW.  There will be a RAM Disk and it's initial contents will
be seeded by the image loaded by the CF Loader.
