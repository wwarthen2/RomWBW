# RomWBW Distribution File Catalog

This document is a reference to the files found on the disk media
distributed with RomWBW.  Specifically, RomWBW provides a set
of floppy and hard disk images in the Binary directory of the
distribution.  The contents of these images is listed here.

The files on the disk images were sourced from a variety of locations.
The primary sources of these files are listed below.  Note that the
primary documentation for each of these sources is listed.  You are
strongly encouraged to refer to this documentation for more information
on using the applications and files listed.

This document primarily describes to contents of the hard disk images.
Floppy disk images may contain a cut down (sub-set) of the files on
a hard disk. This is of course to conserve disk space

Note: This document received a major update in October 2024, when
while still not fully complete, most of the core operating system
disks should now be fully described.

## NZCOM

This disk contains NZ-COM, which is an implementation of the
Z-System.  You may also see NZ-COM referred to as ZCPR 3.4.  This is
a powerful replacement for CP/M 2.2 w/ full backward compatibility.
NZ-COM is extremely configurable and far more powerful than
DRI CP/M.  It is almost mandatory that you read the NZ-COM manual to
use the system effectively.

### NZ-COM OS Files

NZ-COM is not designed to load directly from the boot tracks of a
disk.  Instead, it expects to be loaded from an already running OS.  

This disk has been configured to boot using ZSDOS with a PROFILE.SUB 
command file that automatically loads NZ-COM. So, NZ-COM will load completely 
without any intervention, but you may notice that ZSDOS loads first, 
then ZSDOS loads NZ-COM.

## Z3PLUS

### Z3PLUS OS Files

Z3PLUS is not designed to load directly from the boot tracks of a
disk.  Instead, it expects to be loaded from an already running OS.

This disk has been configured to boot using CP/M 3 with a PROFILE.SUB
command file that automatically loads Z3PLUS. So, Z3PLUS will load completely
without any intervention, but you may notice that CP/M 3 loads first.

The following Z3PLUS files appear in User Area 0

| **File**       | **Source**  | **Description**                                    |

### Z3PLUS Files

The following files came from the official Z3PLUS distribution.  These
are generally documented in the "Z3PLUS Users Manual.pdf" document in
the Doc/CPM directory of the RomWBW distribution. Note:  

NOTE: It may appear theat there are not many files, this is because most of the OS
files are shared with NZCOM. See here for a list [NZ-COM Z3PLUS OS Files]

The following file are in User Area 15, and where noted 10 for help files.

## QPM 2.7

The following files came from from Microcode Consulting. The official
distribution files can be found on the Microcode Consulting website at
[https://www.microcodeconsulting.com/z80/qpm.htm].
Also included in this image are debugz, and linkz frm the same company.

This disk includes the standard DRI CP/M 2.2 files in addition to the
QP/M files.  QP/M generally assumes you already had DRI CP/M 2.2
prior to adding QP/M features.

### QPM 2.7 OS Files

These are built and provide the OS.
QPM Typically has no boot files stored on the disk.
It entirely boots from the system track

The following files appear in User Area 0

| **File**   | **Description**                                            |

The qpm.sys file and the QP/M image on the system
tracks was created using QINSTALL with default settings EXCEPT
for the two settings described under Notes (current drive/user
storage address and TIMDAT vector).

## CP/NET 1.2

User area 4 contains a full implementation of the CP/NET 1.2 client 
provided by Doug Miller. Please refer to
[https://github.com/durgadas311/cpnet-z80] for more information, 
complete documentation and the latest source code.

Please refer to the RomWBW User Guide for instructions on installing
and using these these packages. Either the MT011 RCBus module or the
Duodyne Disk I/O board is required.  In general, to use CP/NET on RomWBW, 
it is intended that you will extract the appropriate set of files 
into your default directory in user area 0.

The following are found in

## Microsoft Basic Compiler

| Floppy Disk Image: **fd_bascomp.img**
| Hard Disk Image: **hd_bascomp.img**

The Microsoft BASIC Compiler is a highly efficient programming tool that
converts BASIC programs from BASIC source code into machine code. This
provides much faster BASIC program execution than has previously been
possible. It can make programs run an average of 3 to 10 times faster than
programs run under BASIC-80. Compiled programs can be up to 30 times
faster than interpreted programs if maximum use of integer variables is
made.

## MSX ROMS

| Hard Disk Image: **hd_msxroms1.img**
| Hard Disk Image: **hd_msxroms2.img**

The collection of MSX ROMs (2 disks) as provided by Les Bird.  
These ROMs are "run" by using the
appropriate variant of Les' MSX8 ROM loader.  You can download the
loader binaries from [https://github.com/lesbird/MSX8].  You will need
appropriate hardware to run the loader.

Please review the file ROMLIST.TXT for information on the current
operational status of the ROM and it's long file name/description.

This disk (RomWBW slice) is not automatically included with the
RomWBW "combo" disk images.  You can simply add it to a combo
image by appending it to the end.  After booting your system,
you can use the ASSIGN command to map the slice to a drive letter.
Refer to the RomWBW User Guide for more information on this
process.

## Z80ASM Macro Assembler

| Floppy Disk Image: **fd_z80asm.img**
| Hard Disk Image: **hd_z80asm.img**

This disk contains 6 major components

* Z80ASM is a relocating macro assembler for CP/M. It takes assembly language
source statements from a disk file, converts them into their binary equivalent,
and stores the output in either a core-image, Intel hex format, or relocatable
object file. The mnemonics recognized are those of Zilog/Mostek. The optional
listing output may be sent to a disk file, the console and/or the printer, in
any combination. Output files may also be generated containing cross-reference
information on each symbol used.

* Z80ASMP (Z80ASM Plus). Referred to as the "Virtual Memory" version which 
uses disk for working storage, thus not constrained by RAM.

* SLR180 is a powerful relocating macro assembler for Z80
compatible CP/M systems. It takes assembly language source
statements from a disk file, converts them into their binary
equivalent, and stores the output in either a core-image, Intel
hex format, or relocatable object file. The mnemonics recognized
are those of Zilog (Z180)/Hitachi. The optional listing output may be
sent to a disk file, the console and/or the printer, in any
combination. Output files may also be generated containing
cross-reference information on each symbol used.

* SLRMAC relocating macro assembler for Intel 8080 mnemonics

* SLRNK is a powerful linking loader for Z80-based CP/M systems.
It takes relocatable binary information in either Microsoft or
SLR Systems format from a disk file, resolves external and entry
point references, and stores the output in memory for execution
or outputs it to a disk file.

* SLRNKP (SLRNK Plus). Referred to as the "Virtual Memory" version which
uses disk for working storage, thus not constrained by RAM.

* Z80DIS is an entirely new disassembler for Z80 based CP/M sys-
tems. Z80DIS is written in TURBO PASCAL. Z80DIS generates Z80
mnemonics and prepares an assembly language file with many
special features for ease of understanding the intent of the
code. The program and documantation are Copyright 1985, by
Kenneth Gielow, Palo Alto, CA. All rights are reserved.
