                 RELEASE.NOT - UPDATE INFORMATION ON Z3PLUS


Please understand that unlike purely commercial enterprises, Z-System is
mainly the work of enthusiasts.  As such, Z-System never truly reaches
completion; each new development is more of a plateau upon which further
innovation occurs.  Though we have done our best, the printed documentation
inevitably lags behind the most recent enhancements.  Try to consult as
much material as possible about a given command before proceeding; if there
is a help or document file pertaining to the command, it supercedes printed
instructions, especially with regard to such matters as syntax or technical
specifications.

===========================

Release 1.02E involves a significant updating of the support utilities
that we distribute as a courtesy with Z3PLUS.  We suggest that any Z-System
user who is not in regular contact with a Z-Node consider taking advantage
of the Z-System Software Update Service (ZSUS).  Here are some of the
important changes with this release.

ZCNFG.COM, CONFIG.LBR:
        Al Hawley has introduced a powerful and convenient method for
        configuring programs.  ZCNFG works either with individual CFG files
        or with CFG files stored in the CONFIG.LBR library.  For example,
        try running the command "ZCNFG ZLT".  ZCNFG will automatically
        extract ZLT15.CFG from CONFIG.LBR.

LBREXT.COM:
        This replaces LGET for extracting member files from LBR library
        files.

ZHELP.COM, LBRHELP.COM, HLPFILES.LBR:
        ZHELP (actually HELPC14) is an improved version of the help utility.
        It can work with normal help files (HLP) and crunched help files
        (HZP).  LBRHELP can work with normal or crunched help files that are
        stored in a library (which is where we have put all the help files
        distributed with NZCOM and Z3PLUS).

DOCFILES.LBR:
        Documentation and help files have been collected into an LBR file.

ZLT.COM:
        This is a full Z-System replacement for LT, and it handles the
        latest LZH-compressed files.

COPY.COM:
        This is the version of COPY from the ZSDOS/ZDDOS release.  Enter
        "COPY //" for syntax information.  It replaces a dangerously
        defective copy program provided with earlier releases.

LSH.COM, LSH.WZ, LSH-HELP.COM, LSHINST.COM, ZERR.COM:
        These are the latest LSH command history shell and command-line
        editor and the associated error handler (fixed-log versions).  These
        completely replace EASE.

CLEDINST.COM, CLEDSAVE.COM:
        A transient history shell like LSH can be slow on floppy systems
        with sluggish disk drives, even if the files have been placed in
        optimal locations.  Some of the RCP modules supplied no include an
        RCP-resident command-line editor called CLED.  Its features can be
        configured using CLEDINST.COM, and the history can be saved to a
        file using CLEDSAVE.COM.

TCAP.LBR, XTCAP.COM:
        A number of programs now require a terminal capabilities descriptor
        (TCAP) with extended functions.  The standard TCAPs loaded with
        TCSELECT do not have these functions.  TCAP.LBR is a collection of
        extended TCAPs for some terminals.  XTCAP.COM is a program that can
        add the most important extensions to a standard TCAP (it is a quick-
        and-dirty fix until the full set of TCAPs is updated).

VIEW.COM:
        This is Bridger Mitchell's file viewing utility.  It is very
        powerful (but it requires an extended TCAP).

NAME.COM:
        This program can quickly add or remove a name for a single
        directory.

TCJ.INF:
        TCJ has a new publisher (one of our own Z-Node sysops), and this
        file tells how to take out a subscription (which all Z-System users
        absolutely should do!).

ZFILEB38.LZT:
        This is the BRIEF listing of all the support programs currently
        available for use with Z-System.  There is another file which
        includes descriptions of all the programs, but it would fill up an
        entire diskette!

1.  TCSELECT PROBLEM.

A problem has been discovered with the operation of TCSELECT as described
in the manual.  TCSELECT is a Z-System program and does not function
reliably under CP/M (on some systems it causes a crash).  Fortunately, there
is a simple fix: reverse the order of the instructions in the manual.  Boot
up Z3PLUS before attempting to create MYTERM.Z3T, and run TCSELECT only
after Z3PLUS is running.  Remember that you need both TCSELECT.COM and
Z3TCAP.TCP to generate your .Z3T file.  The entries in the Z3TCAP library
for the Xerox computers have been patched to correct a long-standing error.


2.  LSH REPLACES EASE.

EASE has been replaced by a newer, more versatile, and well-behaved program
named LSH (Log SHell).  Like EASE, LSH allows you to edit command lines
using WordStar-like control.  Consult LSH.WZ before use for general
information and/or run HELPLSH while running LSH for a display of LSH's
capabilities.  LSHINST installs and customizes LSH to taste.  Error
handling is now taken care of by ZERR.COM, a separate program.  Our great�
thanks to Rob Friefeld for writing these superb Z-System tools and for�
allowing us to include them with NZ-COM.


3.  COPY LDIR.COM TO A0:.

We neglected to include LDIR.COM in the list of files to copy to your A0:
directory.  Some of the examples in the manual will not work correctly if
LDIR is not available as a command.


4.  CHOICE OF MODULE SIZES.

Because of the page alignment of the Z3PLUS system, if the total number of
records required by the NDR, FCP, and RCP combined is an odd number, you
can generally increase the size of one of the modules by 1 record without
losing any additional TPA.  We have, therefore, increased the number of
names in the NDR from 14, as stated in the manual, to 21.  Until you reach
a large number of names (more than 60), you can figure one record of memory
for each 7 names.


5.  YOU NEED REN.COM.

Because there is no resident REN command with the standard version of
Z3PLUS, you should copy the transient version TY4REN.COM to directory A0:
under the name REN.COM.


6.  ZHELP.COM.

The standard form of HELP.COM sets up a file control block with the file
type H?P in it so that either an HLP or a squeezed HQP file can be opened.
While this works with a CP/M-2.2 BDOS (which is happy to open the first
file that matches a wildcard FCB), it is trapped as an error by the
CP/M-Plus BDOS.  The version of ZHELP distributed with Z3PLUS has been
patched to look only for HLP files.  If you pick up any later releases of
this program, it is possible that you will experience this problem.  We
will try to alert the programming community to this problem so that future
Z-System programs will be compatible with CP/M-Plus.


7.  OSBORNE EXECUTIVE ROM BUG.

Testing on an early version (1.20) of the Executive's boot ROM showed that
Z3PLUS would not load because the ROM misused the Z80 index registers.
Version 1.21 of the Osborne Executive ROM works correctly and is available
from FOG (First Osborne Group).  Alternatively, a utility named TPATCH is
available on bulletin boards.  TPATCH can be run after cold-booting the
Executive, and before Z3PLUS is loaded.


8.  SMARTKEY BUGS.

Smartkey II version 1.0A will often not run on banked-memory CP/M Plus
computers; this problem is more likely to occur if Z3PLUS is loaded.  The
SUBMIT file PATCHSK.SUB, which installs PATCH4SK.HEX into Smartkey, appears
to correct this bug.

If you use Smartkey, read the submit file carefully, be sure you have
exactly this version of Smartkey and the other necessary files, and test on
your system.

We and other users would appreciate hearing from you whether/how-well this
works.  We cannot support the Smartkey product but will be happy to make
the source code of the patch available for others to develop further.


9.  COMPATIBILITY WITH BYE.

BYE, the remote access program for CP/M, causes some difficulties when run
with Z3PLUS.  In technical terms, BYE alters the bytes in the CP/M-Plus SCB,
which Z3PLUS uses to tell when a CP/M-Plus SUBMIT job is running, and BYE
does not restore these bytes on exit.  Since SUBMIT jobs have a higher
priority than shells in the Z-System command hierarchy, BYE causes Z3PLUS
to simply return when the user attempts to run shell programs such as
ZFILER or LSH under (or after) BYE.

If you MUST use shells with BYE, you can remove SUBMIT job detection by
installing the patch below.  The only drawback is that SUBMIT and shells
will no longer run concurrently.  However, the new ZEX 5.0 (included in
this package) surpasses SUBMIT for all purposes except startup of Z3PLUS
(not affected by the patch) and extremely TPA-critical situations, so this
should not be a problem.

The patch is as follows.  Extract your DEFCP3.ZRL file from Z3PLUS.LBR.
Use a patcher to look at the first page of the file.  You should find the
string "Z3PLUSCP 6/25/88 v 1.00".  If so, go to offset 985 hex in the file.
The two bytes at this location should be D6 and C3 hex.  Change them to AF
AF.  Now use LPUT or NULU to put DEFCP3.ZRL back in Z3PLUS.LBR and restart
Z3PLUS.


10. MINOR UPDATE NOTES.

- The RCP WHLQ command no longer used.  "WHL" alone displays the current
  wheel status.  As before, "WHL password" turns the wheel byte on.  "WHL
  xxx" now turns the wheel byte OFF if xxx is something other than the
  correct password.

- ARUNZ is now a type-4 program which loads at the highest possible
  memory location so as to save lower memory for immediate re-execution
  with GO.  See ARUNZ09R.DZC and TCJ31.MZG (as well as your NZ-COM or
  Z3PLUS manual) for more on the amazing ARUNZ.

- VLU is no longer included, as it was not reliable.  Please use LDIR,
  LGET, LPUT, and LT instead to manipulate library files.

- At this writing, we are sorry to note that both Z-Node Central and the
  Lillipute Z-Nodes mentioned in Chapter 7 of your manual are out of
  service.  Z-Nodes 2 and 3 are still going strong, however, as are the
  many others listed in ZNODES.LST.  Z-Node 2 is the new Z-Node Central.
  We cannot recommend highly enough that you get a modem and investigate at
  least one Z-Node as a source of inspiration and support.

- Version 5.0 of the ZEX batch processor replaces earlier versions.  ZEX
  now runs under both NZ-COM and Z3PLUS and is a very powerful means of
  customizing programs and commands.  The ZEX.RSX file mentioned in the
  manual is no longer required.  See ZEX50.DZC for help.


11. TO NEW Z-SYSTEM USERS.

- All files whose middle filetype character is "Z" (e.g., SAMPLE.DZC) are
  "crunched" files which must be uncompressed with LT.COM or UNCRUNCH.COM
  before use.

- As outlined in section 4.3.2 of your manual, most Z-System programs
  have built-in help; type the name of any program followed by "//" for a
  short description if you are confused.

- Finally, it is not at all necessary to master every nuance of the system
  before it becomes useful.  Please don't try to devour all of Z-System at
  once.  Instead, we suggest that you decide what aspects of the system you
  will find most helpful and try to master one or two of those before
  exploring further.  We think you will find that if you choose wisely,
  learning one aspect fully not only makes that aspect of your computing
  world easier, it also equips you with the skills and confidence with
  which to surmount other aspects of Z-System more confidently.


12. NEW DEFAULTS AND NEW FILES: FCP.LBR, RCP.LBR.

To minimize disk space requirements, Z3PLUS.LBR contains only some standard
configurations of the FCP and RCP modules.  Alternative versions of these
modules are now supplied in separate libraries.  Modules can be loaded
directly from these libraries, or individual files can be extracted and put
into Z3PLUS.LBR to replace the default files.  Each library has a brief DOC
file describing the modules (some of which are the default versions included
in Z3PLUS.LBR).

Carson Wilson and Rob Friefeld have made some major changes in the RCP code
(see the DOC file in RCP.LBR).  The standard RCP module is now 18 records
long instead of 16, and the large RCP module is 36 records long.  The system
configuration files DEFAULT.Z3P and LARGE.Z3P have been edited to reflect
these changes.  The TPA requirements listed on page 54 of the manual are no
longer correct.
