This is the READ-ME file from the Z80DIS.LBR package, version 2.2
------------------------------------------------------===========




A personal note from the programmer:
- -------- ---- ---- --- ----------

     I	wrote this disassembler because I could not find  another
that would really open up a large foreign program for inspection.
RESOURCE  and all of its spin-offs give you only a pin-hole  look
at  a program without indicating the important interactions  with
other  parts  of the code.  Without the interactions and a  wider
view,  figuring out the code purpose or data type of a code block
is very hard.

     Z80DIS  eliminates  the narrow pin-hole view  of  a  program
provided  by  an  interactive  display.   Z80DIS  provides  fully
automated  analysis of the code structure,  well formatted output
in both assembler and printer formats, a complete cross-reference
coded  by  reference type,  and commenting of  DOS  interactions.
Recent	improvements in this latest version add  further  utility
and increase the ability to handle even larger code segments.

     For those who prefer an interactive approach to disassembly,
I  recommend  the  combination	of Z80DIS  with  the  interactive
disassembler DAZZLESTAR (DZ) by John Washington in  England.  Use
Z80DIS for the automated analysis of the underlying structure and
use  DZ  for  the interactive refinement of the  code.	John  has
provided  a  DZ  command  (namely KG) to  read	the  break  table
produced by Z80DIS.

     As CP/M users are getting less and less support for problems
with existing 8080 or Z80 software products,  maintenance of that
software has fallen to the CP/M users themselves. Z80DIS lets you
examine the software and repair the problem yourself. I hope that
you will find Z80DIS as useful as I have.

Z80DIS 2.2						 04/18/87


Version 2.2 change note:

     Version 2.0 added artificial intelligence to Z80DIS.

     Version 2.1 corrected a small bug in the processing of  INC,
     DEC, and LD using index registers IX and IY and enhanced the
     distinction between ASCII blank (20 hex) and the instruction
     "JR NZ,xxxx" (also 20 hex).

     Version  2.2  modifies the output format for M-80	assembler
     compatibility.  Increases	the size of program that  can  be
     disassembled  by  moving cross-reference tables  to  virtual
     memory  on disk.  Fixed several minor bugs.  Interprets CP/M
     DOS calls and comments such calls by the function performed.

Caveat:  If you are running a system with single sided disks, you
     probably do not want to upgrade from version 2.1 to  version
     2.2 because of the increased off-loading of memory functions
     onto disk files

Z80DIS	is a disassembler for Z80 based CP/M systems.  Z80DIS  is
designed  to  generate	Z80 mnemonics  and  prepare  an  assembly
language   file   with	 many  special	features  for	ease   of
understanding the intent of the disassembled code. The source for
Z80DIS has grown to 8400 lines of pascal code.

With  Z80DIS versions 2.0 and higher,  you need know very  little
about  the format of the *.COM file to produce a nearly  finished
source	file  in  most	cases.	In addition  a	large  number  of
convenience  features and defaults have been added that were  not
present  in version 1.	The Z80DIS change history for version 2.x
follows at the end of this paper.

Both  the  Z80DIS  program and the Z80DIS documentation  are  (C)
Copyright  1985,  1986	and 1987 by Kenneth  Gielow;  All  Rights
Reserved. While I am freely distributing the binary code for non-
profit use, I am reserving the source code as a trade secret.

This  program requires a Z80 based computer running CP/M  version
2.2  or  higher.  The code was compiled for a 50K  TPA;  the  top
address   is  C7FF.   This  slightly  small  size  was	done  for
compatibility with CP/M 3.0 and ZCPR3.

The  following	files  will be found  on  Z80DIS21.LBR	for  this
program distribution library package:

     Z80DIS.COM    - the disassembler program
     Z80DIS.000    - overlay file for Z80DIS
     Z80DIS.001    - overlay file for Z80DIS
     Z80DIS.002    - overlay file for Z80DIS

     ZDINSTAL.COM  - a terminal command installation program
     ZDINSTAL.MSG  - contains text of ZDINSTAL messages
     ZDINSTAL.DTA  - contains terminal characteristics data

     Z80DIS22.DQC  - an installation manual. (Squeezed format)

The  three  ZDINSTAL files are based on the TURBO  Toolbox  GINST
program  and  will tailor the display command sequences for  your
terminal.  The DOC file is the text of a short user manual  which
explains use and installation of the program.

The  interactive  displays for parameter specification	make  the
program easy to use.  All control parameters have defaults preset
to the most likely values.

		       FEATURES OF Z80DIS
		       ------------------

The  major  feature  of Z80DIS is an extensive	analysis  of  the
memory	usage by the program under investigation.  This  analysis
capability  forms the basis for an automatic partitioning of  the
code to generate the break table.  This analysis also produces	a
fully-annotated cross reference of all addresses.

A  disassembler  must know whether the bytes are instructions  or
data  in order to proceed.  Z80DIS is the first  disassembler  to
produce  its  own  break table for this  purpose.  Some  previous
programs, such as RESOURCE, have included a search for ASCII text
regions,  but have left the verification and interpretation up to
the  user.  Most other disassemblers are fooled by the	trick  of
adding	nonsense bytes after jumps to cause the analysis to  fall
out of synchronization with instruction code interpretation.

Z80DIS	produces  an output listing which itemizes all	addresses
referenced by the code,  distinguishes types of label references,
marks  subroutines  and jumps and produces  an	annotated  cross-
reference.  This  listing shows the exact mode of usage for every
reference:  Jump absolute, Jump relative, Call, Restart, Load 16-
bit,  Store 16-bit, Immediate 16-bit, Load 8-bit, Store 8-bit. In
version  2.1,  this listing also shows the break table region  of
residency  for	each label so that you may inspect the	list  for
inconsistencies.

An  address  labeling  convention assists  in  understanding  the
assembly  code generated.  Each label generated on  the  assembly
listing  indicates,  by format,  not only the generic type (Jump,
Call, Data, Other) of any references, but also the singularity of
the reference. For example, J$02E3 used at address 02E3 indicates
that  only  one reference was made to address 02E3 and that  that
reference was a JUMP.

In  addition to helping you by automatic analysis of memory  use,
Z80DIS also assists you by styling the presentation of the disas-
sembled code.  The disassembled code is output in two forms: Both
the usual *.MAC file and a printer formatted *.PRN file.

The  *.PRN file is styled to look like the output of an assembler
with both the instructions and assembled bytes shown.  The juxta-
position  of  the hexadecimal bytes and  the  assembly	mnemonics
allows	the  user  to recognize errors caused by  an  incorrectly
defined break table.

		      DOCUMENTATION NOTICE
		      --------------------

The  original,	version 1,  user manual ran forty-plus pages  and
gave extensive examples and used disassembly of the public domain
program  D.COM as an example.

The version 2 manual is now eighty eight pages of detailed, what-
if instructions and a dissertation on understanding and  handling
large  or complex code modules.

As  the binary code for Z80DIS is now running 108K bytes and  the
ascii  text for the manual is over 200K bytes,	there is  no  way
that  I can get system operators to carry both.  I feel that  the
program  is largely self explanatory so that you can get  started
very  well  with only the minimal help of the included DOC  file.
The  short user manual included here deals only  with  installing
the  Z80DIS  program  and doing a simple  disassembly.	For  more
serious work you will want the full manual.

The  longer manual expands on the discussion of the features  and
explains  the  step-wise  approach to dealing  with  much  larger
source codes. The manual also deals with disassembling code which
relocates  itself.  Extensive  examples are included.  All  error
messages and secondary options are discussed in detail.

The full Z80DIS USER MANUAL is available by mail.  I am asking	a
nominal  charge  of $20.00 which includes the printed  and  bound
manual,  postage,  handling,  and an update notification service.
You  are  granted the right to make not-for-profit copies of  the
manual.  The program itself is not available by mail as I do  not
have   extensive,   multi-format   disk  copy	capability.   The
notification  service will consist of a letter to you  anytime	a
new version is released so that you may be on the lookout for it.

To  order a copy of the Z80DIS USER MANUAL,  send a request  with
your name, address, and a check for $ 20.00 to --
