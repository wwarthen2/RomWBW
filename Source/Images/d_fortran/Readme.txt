===== Microsoft Fortran-80 Compiler v.3.44 =====

This is Microsoft's implementation of the FORTRAN scientific-oriented high level
programming language. It was one of their early core languages developed for the
8-bit computers and later brought to the 8086 and IBM PC. In 1993 Microsoft
rebranded the product as Microsoft Fortran Powerstation. (Note: -80 refers to
the 8080/Z80 platform, not the language specification version)
