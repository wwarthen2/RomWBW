brings the world's most widely used computer programming language to the 
microcomputer user. COBOL-80 is comparable to COBOL systems found on mini-
computers and large mainframes. Consequently, it greatly enhances the
usefulness of microcomputers because it gives users access to the

COBOL-80 is a standard, COBOL programs written on other computers may
be run easily on 8080, z-80 or 8085 systems.
