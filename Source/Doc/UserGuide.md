#### Preface

This document is a general usage guide for the RomWBW software and is
generally the best place to start with RomWBW.

On a personal note, I found this document very difficult to write.
Members of the retro-computing community have dramatically different
experiences, skill levels, and desires.  I realize some readers will
find this document far too basic.  Others will find it lacking in many
areas.  I am doing my best and encourage you to provide constructive
feedback.

#### Conventions Used

##### Size Suffixes

Within the documentation and in RomWBW in general, the use of size
suffixes KB, MB, GB, and TB refer to the binary variant as shown
below.  The modern suffixes (KiB, MiB, etc.) are not used here because
they were not prevalent during the time that the RomWBW OSes were
used.  This keeps all of RomWBW and associated applications consistent.

| Suffix     | Value     | Meaning                                |
|------------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| KB         | 1024      | 1,024 bytes                            |
| MB         | 1024^2^   | 1,048,576 bytes                        |
| GB         | 1024^3^   | 1,073,741,824 bytes                    |
| TB         | 1024^4^   | 1,099,511,627,776 bytes                |

##### Links and URLs

Many of the references in the documentation to Internet addresses (URLs)
do not provide the address in the text.  However, these links are
embedded and "clickable" within the documents.  Your PDF viewer should
highlight these links in some manner (typically an alternate color
or an underline).

# Getting Started

## Installation

In general, installation of RomWBW on your platform is very simple. You
just need to program your ROM with the correct ROM image from the RomWBW
distribution.  Subsequently, you can write disk images on your disk
drives (IDE disk, CF Card, SD Card, etc.) which then provides even more
functionality.

Depending on how you got your hardware, you may have already been
provided with a pre-programmed ROM chip. If so, use that initially.
Otherwise, you will need to use a ROM programmer to initially program
your ROM chip. Please refer to the documentation that came with your ROM
programmer for more information.

The fully-built distribution releases are available on the
[RomWBW Releases Page](https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/releases)
(<https://github.com/wwarthen/RomWBW/releases>) of the repository.

The distribution is a .zip archive. After
downloading it to a working directory on your modern computer
(Windows/Linux/Mac) use any zip tool to extract the contents of the
archive.

The Binary directory of the distribution contains the pre-built ROM images.  
Refer to $doc_hardware$ to identify the correct ROM image for your system.

A complete list of the currently supported platforms is found in
$doc_hardware$. You must burn the correct ROM image that matches your hardware

Once you have a running RomWBW system, you can generally update your ROM
to a newer version in-situ with the included ROM Flashing tool (Will 
Sowerbutts' FLASH application) as described in the [Upgrading] chapter
of this document.

## System Startup

Initially, don't worry about trying to write a disk image to any disk 
(or CF/SD/USB) devices you have.  This will be covered later.  You will 
be able to boot and check out your system with just the ROM.

Connect a serial terminal or computer with terminal emulation software 
to the primary serial port of your CPU board. You may need to refer to 
your hardware provider's documentation for details. A null-modem 
connection may be required. Set the baud rate as indicated in $doc_hardware$.
Set the line characteristics to 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no 
parity, and no flow control. If possible, select ANSI or VT-100 terminal
emulation.  Hardware flow control is not required for terminal
operation, but may be necessary for [Serial Port Transfers].

RomWBW will automatically attempt to detect and support typical add-on
components for each of the systems supported. More information on the
required system configuration and optional supported components for
each ROM is found in $doc_hardware$ .

Upon power-up, your terminal should display a sign-on banner within 2
seconds followed by hardware inventory and discovery information. When
hardware initialization is completed, a boot loader prompt allows you to
choose a ROM-based operating system, system monitor, application, or boot
from a disk device.

### Core System Information

During startup, the first few lines of information displayed provide the
most basic information on your system.  In the example above, these
lines are the Core System Information:

```
RomWBW HBIOS v3.5, 2025-03-01

RCBus [RCZ80_kio] Z80 @ 7.372MHz
0 MEM W/S, 1 I/O W/S, INT MODE 2, Z2 MMU
512KB ROM, 512KB RAM
ROM VERIFY: 00 00 00 00 PASS
```

The first line is a version identification banner for RomWBW.  After
that you see a group of 4 lines describing the basic system.  In this
example, the platform is the RCBus running a configuration named
"RCZ80_kio".  The CPU is a Z80 with a current clock speed of 7.372 MHz.
There are 0 memory wait states and 1 I/O wait state.  Z80 interrupt mode
2 is active and the bank memory manager is type "Z2" which is standard
for RCBus.  The system has 512KB of ROM total and 512KB of RAM total.
Finally, a verification of the checksums of the critical ROM banks is
shown (all 4 should be 00).

RomWBW attempts to detect the running configuration of the
system at startup.  Depending on your hardware, there may be
inaccuracies in this section.  For example, in some cases the CPU clock
speed is assumed rather than actually measured.  This does not generally
affect the operation of your system.  If you want to correct any of the
information displayed, you can create a custom ROM which is described
later.

### Hardware Discovery

The next set of messages during boot show the hardware devices as
they are probed and initially configured.  In the example above, these
lines are:

```
KIO: IO=0x80 ENABLED
CTC: IO=0x84 TIMER MODE=TIM16
AY: MODE=RCZ80 IO=0xD8 NOT PRESENT
SIO0: IO=0x89 SIO MODE=115200,8,N,1
SIO1: IO=0x8B SIO MODE=115200,8,N,1
DSRTC: MODE=STD IO=0xC0 NOT PRESENT
MD: UNITS=2 ROMDISK=384KB RAMDISK=256KB
FD: MODE=RCWDC IO=0x50 NOT PRESENT
IDE: IO=0x10 MODE=RC
IDE0: NO MEDIA
IDE1: NO MEDIA
PPIDE: IO=0x20
PPIDE0: LBA BLOCKS=0x00773800 SIZE=3815MB
PPIDE1: NO MEDIA
```

What you see will depend on your specific system and ROM, but should
match the hardware present in your system.  Each device has a tag that
precedes the colon.  This tag identifies the driver and instance of each
device.  For example, the tag "SIO0:" refers to the SIO serial port
driver and specifically the first channel.  The "SIO1:" tag refers to
the second channel.

In many cases you will see IO=0xNN in the data following the tag.  This
identifies the base I/O port address of the hardware device and is
useful for identifying hardware conflicts.

Note that you may see some lines indicating that the associated
hardware is not present.  Above, you can see that the FD driver
did not find a floppy interface.  Lines such as these are completely
normal when your system does not have the associated hardware.

Finally, be aware that all ROMs are configured to identify specific
hardware devices at specific port addresses.  If you add hardware
to your system that is not automatically identified, you may need
to build a custom ROM to add support for it.  Building a custom ROM
is covered later.

$doc_hardware$ contains a list of the RomWBW hardware
devices which may help you identify the hardware discovered in your
system.

### Device Unit Assignments

In order to support a wide variety of hardware, RomWBW HBIOS uses a
modular approach to implementing device drivers and presenting devices
to an operating system. In general, all devices are classified as
one of the following:

* Disk (RAM/ROM Disk, Floppy Disk, Hard Disk, CF Card, SD Card, etc.)
* Character (Serial Ports, Parallel Ports, etc.)
* Video (Video Display/Keyboard Interfaces)
* Sound (Audio Playback Devices)
* RTC/NVRAM (Real Time Clock, Non-volatile RAM)
* System (Internal Services, e.g. Timer, DMA, etc.)

HBIOS uses the concept of unit numbers to present a generic set of
hardware devices to the operating system. As an example, a typical
system might have a ROM Disk, RAM Disk, Floppy Drives, and Disk
Drives. All of these are considered disk devices and are presented
to the operating system as generic block devices. This means that
each operating system does not need to embed code to interact directly
with all of the different hardware devices -- RomWBW takes care of that.

In the final group of startup messages, a device unit summary table is
displayed so that you can see how the actual hardware devices have
been mapped to unit numbers during startup.

```
Unit        Device      Type              Capacity/Mode
----------  ----------  ----------------  --------------------
Char 0      UART0:      RS-232            38400,8,N,1
Char 1      UART1:      RS-232            38400,8,N,1
Disk 0      MD1:        RAM Disk          384KB,LBA
Disk 1      MD0:        ROM Disk          384KB,LBA
Disk 2      FD0:        Floppy Disk       3.5",DS/HD,CHS
Disk 3      FD1:        Floppy Disk       3.5",DS/HD,CHS
Disk 4      IDE0:       CompactFlash      3815MB,LBA
Disk 5      IDE1:       Hard Disk         --
Disk 6      PRPSD0:     SD Card           1886MB,LBA
Video 0     CVDU0:      CRT               Text,80x25
```

In this example, you can see that the system has a total of 7 Disk
Units numbered 0-6. There are also 2 Character Units and 1 Video
Unit. The table shows the unit numbers assigned to each of the
devices. Notice how the unit numbers are assigned sequentially
regardless of the specific device.

There may or may not be media in the disk devices listed. For example,
the floppy disk devices (Disk Units 2 & 3) may not have a floppy in
the drive. Also note that Disk Unit 4 shows a disk capacity, but
Disk Unit 5 does not. This is because the PPIDE interface of the
system supports up to two drives, but there is only one actual drive
attached. A unit number is assigned to all available devices
regardless of whether they have actual media installed at boot time.

Note that Character Unit 0 is the initial system console unless modified
in a customized ROM image.

If your system has an RTC/NVRAM device, it will not be listed in the
unit summary table. Since only a single RTC/NVRAM device can exist in
one system, unit numbers are not required nor used for this type of
device.  Also, System devices are not listed because they are entirely
internal to RomWBW.

## Startup Example

Here is an example of a fairly typical startup.  Your system will have
different devices and configuration, but the startup should look
similar.

```
RomWBW HBIOS v3.5, 2025-03-01

RCBus [RCZ80_kio] Z80 @ 7.372MHz
0 MEM W/S, 1 I/O W/S, INT MODE 2, Z2 MMU

KIO: IO=0x80 ENABLED
CTC: IO=0x84 TIMER MODE=TIM16
AY: MODE=RCZ80 IO=0xD8 NOT PRESENT
SIO0: IO=0x89 SIO MODE=115200,8,N,1

Char 1      SIO1:       RS-232            115200,8,N,1
Disk 0      MD0:        RAM Disk          256KB,LBA
Disk 1      MD1:        ROM Disk          384KB,LBA
Disk 2      IDE0:       Hard Disk         --
Disk 3      IDE1:       Hard Disk         --
Disk 4      PPIDE0:     CompactFlash      3815MB,LBA
Disk 5      PPIDE1:     Hard Disk         --
```

If your system completes the ROM-based boot process successfully, you
should see the RomWBW Boot Loader prompt.  For example:

```
RCBus [RCZ80_kio] Boot Loader

Boot [H=Help]:
```

If you get to this prompt, your system has completed the boot process
and is ready to accept commands.  Note that the Boot Loader is not
an operating system or application.  It is essentially the point where
you choose which operating system or application you want RomWBW to
execute.

The Boot Loader is explained in detail in the next section.  For now,
you can try a few simple commands to confirm that you can interact
with the system.

At the Boot Loader prompt, you can type `H <enter>` for help.  You
can type `L <enter>` to list the available built-in ROM applications.
If your terminal supports ANSI escape sequences, you can try the
'P' command to play a simple on-screen game.  Instructions for the
game are found in $doc_apps$.

If all of this seems fine, your ROM has been successfully programmed.

# Boot Loader Operation

Once your system has completed the startup process, it presents a
Boot Loader command prompt.  The purpose of the Boot Loader is to
select and launch a desired application or operating system.  It also
has the ability to configure some aspects of system operation.

After starting your system, following the hardware initialization, you
will see the RomWBW Boot Loader prompt.  Below is an example.  Note
that the text preceding "Boot Loader" will vary and identifies your
specific system and configuration.

```
Mark IV [MK4_wbw] Boot Loader

Boot [H=Help]:
```

From the Boot Loader prompt, you can enter commands to select and launch any of
the RomWBW operating systems or ROM applications.  It also allows you to
manage some basic settings of the system.  To enter a command, just
enter the command followed by ***\<enter\>***.

For example, typing `H<enter>` will display a short command summary:

```
Boot [H=Help]: h

  L           - List ROM Applications
  D           - Device Inventory
  R           - Reboot System
  W           - RomWBW Configure
  I <u> [<c>] - Set Console Interface/Baud Rate
  V [<n>]     - View/Set HBIOS Diagnostic Verbosity
  <u>[.<s>]   - Boot Disk Unit/Slice
```

Likewise the `L` command (List ROM Applications) will display the list of ROM Applications that
you can launch right from the Boot Loader:

```
Boot [H=Help]: L

ROM Applications:

  M: Monitor
  Z: Z-System
  C: CP/M 2.2
  F: Forth
  B: BASIC
  T: Tasty BASIC
  P: Play a Game
  N: Network Boot
  X: XModem Flash Updater
  U: User App
```

A more complete description of these options is found below in
[System Management].

## Starting Applications from ROM

To start a ROM application you just enter the corresponding letter at
the Boot Loader prompt.  In the following example, we launch the
built-in Microsoft BASIC interpreter.  From within BASIC, we use the
`BYE` command to return to the Boot Loader:

```
Boot [H=Help]: b

Loading BASIC...
Memory top?
Z80 BASIC Ver 4.7b
Copyright (C) 1978 by Microsoft
55603 Bytes free
Ok
bye


Mark IV [MK4_wbw] Boot Loader

Boot [H=Help]:
```

The following ROM applications and OSes are available at the boot loader
prompt:

| **Application**   | **Description**                                                |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Monitor           | Z80 system debug monitor w/ Intel Hex loader                   |
| CP/M 2.2          | Digital Research CP/M 2.2 OS                                   |
| Z-System          | ZSDOS 1.1 w/ ZCPR 1 (Enhanced CP/M compatible OS)              |
| Forth             | Brad Rodriguez's ANSI compatible Forth language                |
| BASIC             | Microsoft ROM BASIC                                            |
| Tasty&nbsp;BASIC  | Dimitri Theuling's Tiny BASIC implementation                   |
| Play              | A simple video game (requires ANSI terminal emulation)         |
| Network&nbsp;Boot | Boot system via Wiznet MT011 device                            |
| Flash&nbsp;Update | Upload and flash a new ROMWBW image using xmodem               |
| User App          | User written application placeholder                           |

The User App is provided as a way to access a custom written
ROM module.  In the pre-built ROMs, selecting User App will just
return to the Boot Loader menu.  If you are interested in creating a
custom application to run here, review the "usrrom.asm" file in the
Source/HBIOS folder of the distribution.

Each of the ROM Applications is documented in $doc_apps$.  Some
of the applications (such as BASIC) also have their own independent
manual in the Doc directory of the distribution.  The OSes included
in the ROM (CP/M 2.2 & Z-System) are described in the Operating Systems
chapter of this document.

In general, the command to exit any of these applications and restart
the system is `BYE`. The exceptions are the Monitor which uses `X` and
Play which uses `Q`.

**NOTE:** Of the ROM Applications, only the operating systems (CP/M and 
Z-System) have the ability to interact with disk drives. So, other than 
these 2 OSes, the ROM Applications do **not** have any way to save or 
load data from peristent/disk storage.  For example, if you launch BASIC
from the Boot Loader, you will not be able to save or load your 
programs.  You will need to start an operating system first and then run
BASIC in order to save or load programs.

Two of the ROM Applications are, in fact, complete operating systems.
Specifically, "CP/M 2.2" and "Z-System" are provided so that you can
actually start either operating system directly from your ROM.  This
technique is useful when:

* You don't yet have any real disk drives in your system
* You want to setup real disk drives for the first time
* You are upgrading your system and need to upgrade your real disk drives

The RAM disk and ROM disk drives will be available even if you have
no physical disk devices attached to your system.

Booting an operating system from ROM is not intended as a way to use
your operating system on a long-term basis.  The ROM disk has only
a small subset of the operating system files.  Additionally, you
cannot easily customize your ROM disk because you cannot write to it.
For any significant use of an operating system, you should boot directly
to the disk/slice that contains the complete operating system.  This
is described in the next section.

## Starting Operating Systems from Disk

In order to make use of the more sophisticated operating systems
available with RomWBW, you will need to boot an operating system
from a disk.  Setting up disks is described in detail later.  For now,
we will just go over the command line for performing this type of boot.

From the Boot Loader prompt, you can enter a number (***\<diskunit\>***)
and optionally a dot followed by a second number (***\<slice\>***).  The
***\<disk unit\>*** unit number refers to a disk unit that was displayed
when the system was booted -- essentially it specifies the specific
physical disk drive you want to boot.  The ***\<slice\>*** numbers refers
to a portion of the disk unit to boot.  If no slice is specified, then
it is equivalent to booting from the first slice (slice 0).  Disk units
and slices are described in more detail later.

Following this, you should see the operating system startup
messages. Your operating system prompt will typically be `A>` and
when you look at the drive letter assignments, you should see that A:
has been assigned to the disk and slice you selected to boot.

If you receive the error message "Disk not bootable!", you have
either failed to properly initialize the disk and slice requested
or you have selected an invalid/unavailable disk/slice.

The following example shows a disk boot into the first slice of disk
unit 4 which happens to be the CP/M 2.2 operating system on this disk.
This is accomplished by entering just the number '4' and pressing
***\<enter\>***.

```
Boot [H=Help]: 4

        E:=FD1:0

```

Notice that a list of drive letters and their assignments to RomWBW
devices and slices is displayed during the initialization of the
operating system.

Here is another example where we are booting disk unit 4, slice 3
which is the CP/M 3 operating system on this disk:

```
Boot [H=Help]: 4.3

Booting Disk Unit 4, Slice 3, Sector 0x0000C800...

```

Some operating systems (such as CP/M 3 shown above) do not list the
drive assignments during initialization.  In this case, you can use the
`ASSIGN` command to display the current assignments.

The Boot Loader simply launches whatever is in the disk unit/slice you
have specified.  It does not know what operating system is at that
location.  The layout of operating systems on disk media is described in
the [Disk Images] section of this document.

### Auto-Submit Batch Files

All of the operating systems supplied with RomWBW have the ability to 
execute a "batch" of commands by creating a batch submission file 
containing the commands to be executed. The mechanism for running 
commands automatically at startup varies by operating system.  In some 
cases, it was built into the original operating system.  In other cases,
I have added this capability in the RomWBW BIOS of the operating 
system.

In all cases, the file containing the commands to run at startup must
be on the boot drive (A:).  RomWBW automatically assigns A: to the
disk slice you choose to boot.  Adding a startup command file to the
ROM Disk is not recommended because it would require customizing and
building a new ROM.  Use of bootable disk slices is preferred since
the startup command files can be added/edited without any special
system customization.

Here is an overview for each operating system:

- **CP/M 2.2** - Will run PROFILE.SUB as a SUBMIT file if it exists in
  A: at startup.  Note that original CP/M 2.2 itself did not have this
  ability -- it was added to the RomWBW CP/M 2.2 BIOS.  The use of SUBMIT
  files is documented in Section 1.6.7 SUBMIT Command of the CPM Manual 
  included in the Doc/CPM folder of the RomWBW distribution.

- **Z-System (ZSDOS 1.1)** - Will run run PROFILE.SUB as a SUBMIT file 
  if it exists in A: at startup.  Works exactly the same as CP/M 2.2.
  The original Z-System ZSDOS 1.1 did not have this ability -- it was
  added to the RomWBW Z-System BIOS.  The Z-System documentation does
  not cover the use of SUBMIT files -- please refer to the CP/M 2.2
  documentation.

- **NZCOM** - Will run the command STARTZCM at startup.  This is
  normally an alias file, which you can edit using SALIAS.  Please see 
  Section 3.1 Creating an Alias of the NZCOM Users Manual included in the 
  Doc/CPM folder of the RomWBW distribution.  Do not modify this 
  file unless you fully understand the NZCOM boot process. Note that 
  NZCOM itself is launched from ZSDOS via the included PROFILE.SUB file.

- **CP/M 3** - Will run PROFILE.SUB as a SUBMIT file if it exists in A: 
  at startup.  This mechanism is built into the CP/M 3 operating system.  
  Please see Section 4.5 Executing Multiple Commands and Section 5.2.74 
  Executing the SUBMIT Command of the CPM3 Users Guide included in the 
  Doc/CPM folder of the RomWBW distribution.

- **Z3PLUS** - Will run the command STARTZ3P at startup.  This is
  normally an alias file, which you can edit using SALIAS.  Please see
  Section 3.1 Creating an Alias of the Z3PLUS Users Manual included in the
  Doc/CPM folder of the RomWBW distribution.  Do not modify this
  file unless you fully understand the Z3PLUS boot process. Note that 
  Z3PLUS itself is launched from CP/M 3 via the included PROFILE.SUB file.

- **ZPM3** - Will run the command STARTZPM at startup.  This is normally
  an alias file.  You use SALIAS to edit such files.  ZPM3 has no real 
  documentation.  The NZCOM documentation of STARTZCM is generally correct
  for ZPM3.

Since RomWBW can utilize many disk slices, it is very easy to create 
slices for specific workflows (editing, software development, games, 
etc.). You can then just boot to the slice that is optimized for the 
task you want to perform.  Each such slice may have its own startup
command batch file that customizes the environment for the specific
workflow desired.

## System Management

### Listing Device Inventory

The device units available in your system are listed in the
boot messages.  However, if that list has scrolled off of your
screen, you can use the 'D' command to display a list of them at
any time from the Boot Loader prompt.

```
Unit        Device      Type              Capacity/Mode

Sound 0     SND0:       AY-3-8910         3+1 CHANNELS
```

### Rebooting the System

The 'R' command within the Boot Loader performs a software reset of
the system.  The system will perform a startup just like powering
up or pressing the hardware reset button (although the hardware is
not physically reset).

There is generally no need to do this, but it can be convenient when
you want to see the boot messages again or ensure your system is in
a clean state.

```
Boot [H=Help]: r

Restarting System...
```

### Setting NVRAM Options

On systems with RTC devices (that have Non-Volatile RAM), RomWBW supports storing
some limited configuration option options inside this NVRAM.

Several configuration options are currently supported, these are known as Switches

* Specify Automatic boot at startup, after an optional delay (AB)
* Define the Disk or ROM App to be booted at for automatic boot (BO)

RomWBW uses bytes located at the start of RTC NVRAM, and includes a checksum of 
the bytes in NVRAM to check for integrity before using the configuration.

Initially NVRAM has to be reset (with default values), before it can be used.
As well as setting defaults, it also writes the correct checksum, and allows the
NVRAM to be accessed and to store the RomWBW config.

This is an explicit step that must be done, as any existing data stored is overwritten.
If you are using NVRAM for other purposes, then you can continue to do so
so long as you do NOT perform this Reset step.

NVRAM may also need to be reset in these circumstances:

* When there has been a loss of power to the NVRAM.
* When upgrading to a new RomWBW version, or a RomWBW version that has new switches.
* If the NVRAM has been overwritten by another application.

If you want to continue to use NVRAM in your applications you may want to consider storing
your data above the RomWBW Switch data.

To configure these options an inbuilt ROM application is provided which can be accessed
by the command "`W`" from the RomWBW boot menu.

This application is also built as a CP/M utility, but is not included on an disk image, 
it is found in the `Binary/Applications` folder of the RomWBW distribution.

For further guidance on using this application please see the section 
"RomWBW System Configuration" in the $doc_apps$ document.

If your system has both a [Front Panel] as well as NVRAM, be aware that
the Front Panel switches take precedence over the NVRAM configuration
settings.

Note that the WizNet class of Network devices also contain NVRAM which is
entirely separate from the RomWBW configuration NVRAM described here.  A
separate utility is used to set the WizNet NVRAM (see [CP/NET Client Setup]).

[RomWBW Applications]($doc_root$/RomWBW Applications.pdf)

### Changing Console and Console Speed

Your system can support a number of devices for the console. They may
be VDU type devices or serial devices. If you want to change which
device is the console, the ***I*** menu option can be used to choose
the unit and its speed.

The command format is ```I <unit> [<baudrate>]```

where ***\<unit\>*** is the character unit to select and ***\<baudrate\>***
is the optional baud rate.

Supported baud rates are:
```
 75   450  1800   7200  38400  115200   460800  1843200
150   600  2400   9600  28800  153600   614400  2457600
225   900  3600  14400  57600  230400   921600  3686400
300  1200  4800  19200  76800  307200  1228800  7372800
```

Here is an example of changing the console to unit #1 (the second
serial port) and switching the port to 9600 baud:

```
Boot [H=Help]: i 1 9600

  Change speed now. Press a key to resume.

  Console on Unit #1
```

At this point, the Boot Loader prompt will be displayed on character
unit #1.

Note that not all character devices support changing baud rates and
some only support a limited subset of the baud rates listed.  If you
attempt to select an invalid baud rate for your system, you will get
an error message.

### HBIOS Diagnostic Verbosity

The 'V' command of the Boot Loader allows you to view and optionally
change the level of diagnostic messages that RomWBW will produce.
The normal verbosity level is 4, which means to display only fatal
errors.  You can increase this level to see more warnings when function
calls to RomWBW HBIOS detect problems.

The use of diagnostic levels above 4 are really intended only for
software developers.  I do not recommend changing this under
normal circumstances.

## Console Takeover

If your system has more than one character unit, then the Boot Loader 
will "poll" all of the character devices for a request to make any of 
the alternate character devices the active console.  This is called a 
console takeover request.  This functionality must be enabled in the ROM
build configuration, but currently it is for all standard ROMs.

To request a console takeover, you just press the \<space\> character 
twice in a row at the port or terminal that you want to move the console
to.  The terminal or communication software **must** be configured for 
the default serial port speed and data bits for this to work.

A takeover request is only possible while the active console is
showing the Boot Loader prompt prior to typing any characters at
the active console.  In other words, once you start typing at the
active console prompt, the takeover polling is suspended.  If you have
started typing characters, you can press \<enter\> at the active
console to get a fresh Boot Loader prompt and reactivate the polling.

If you have built a custom ROM that includes an automatic boot
command with a timeout, then performing a console takeover will
abort the timeout process and the automatic boot command will not be
performed.

## Front Panel

RomWBW supports the concept of a simple front panel.  The following 
image is a conceptual view of such a front panel.  If your system has a 
front panel, it should look similar to the [RomWBW Front Panel](#panel).

![RomWBW Front Panel](Graphics/Panel){#panel width=50% }

The LEDs in the top row of the panel are used for multiple purposes.
They are initially used to display the progress of the
system boot.  This may help in diagnosing a hardware or configuration
issue in a system that does not progress far enough to display text
output on the console.  The meaning of the LEDs is:

|            |                              |
|------------|------------------------------|
| `O-------` | System Boot has started      |
| `OO------` | Common RAM bank activated    |
| `OOO-----` | HBIOS transitioned to RAM    |
| `OOOO----` | Basic initialization done    |
| `OOOOO---` | CPU detection complete       |
| `OOOOOO--` | System timer configured      |
| `OOOOOOO-` | Pre-console device init done |
| `OOOOOOOO` | Console activation           |

Once the system has booted, the LEDs are used to indicate disk device
activity.  Each LED numbered 7-0 represents disk units 7-0.  As each
disk device performs I/O, the LED will light while the disk is active.
This is only possible for the first 8 disk units.

The second row of the front panel is composed of switches that allow
you to control a few aspects of the system startup. The switches are 
also re-read during warm boot, so confirm the switch settings are your
desired boot configuration before executing 'REBOOT /W'.
 
The first two switches affect the device used as the initial console.
 
| CRT/Serial | Sec/Pri | Explanation                                                 |
|------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------|

| Serial     | Pri     | Boot Console is Primary Serial Port                         |
| Serial     | Sec     | Boot Console is Secondary Serial Port                       |

If not available (default): "Char Unit 0" is used

The final six switches allow you to select the desired boot device.

# Disk Management

The systems supported by RomWBW all have the ability to use persistent 
disk media. Some systems have disk interfaces built-in, while others 
will require add-in cards. You will need to refer to the documentation 
for your system for your specific options.

The RomWBW firmware provides a hardware abstraction layer, 
All disks will work on all hardware variations.
This means you can remove disk media from one RomWBW system and
put it in a different RomWBW system. The only constraint is that the
applications on the disk media must be up to date with the firmware on
the system being used.

## Key Terminology/Concepts

The following important terminology applies

#### Disk (or Disk Drive)

The hardware storage device that RomWBW talks to. 
RomWBW supports a variety of storage disk device types.

* ROM Disk - RomWBW firmware - containing CPM utilities
* RAM Disk - A section of system RAM initially empty
* Floppy Disk(s) - Removable media
* Hard Disk(s) - Includes CF Cards, SD Cards, USB Stick, etc.

The different disk types are further defined in the section [Disk Types].

#### Media

The storage device inserted into a disk drive, e.g. a floppy disk, CF 
Card, SD Card, etc.

#### Slice

For hard disks a Slice is a smaller logical block of disk space that is 
allocated and formatted with a filesystem and typically allocated to a 
Drive letter. Slices allow large modern storage media to be sliced up 
into smaller units compatible with CP/M. Slices should not be confused 
with partitions, a slice is not a partition.

The concept of slices is described in detail in the section
[Hard Disk Slices].

#### Drive

The mapping of a hardware disk (and slice) to a Drive letter 
in an operating system. A Drive has a file system installed on it 

#### Disk Image

A disk image is a predefined image of a complete CP/M filesystem, 
or filesystem(s), including any partition tables (for hard disk images).
Each disk image has the complete set of normal applications and tools
distributed with the associated operating system or application suite.

This comes in for form of a file which is suitable for copying directly 
onto target media, using a modern computer. It is generally easier to 
use these disk images than transferring files over individually. 
See the section [Disk Images] for further details.

## Startup Hardware Discovery

During startup RomWBW performs detection for hardware supported by your 
platform. During startup you will see messages for any disk 
interface(s), listing device types (e.g. FD:, IDE:, SD:), and any media 
that has been found on these interfaces. The messages you see will vary 
depending on your hardware and the media you have installed.

As an example, here are the messages you might see if you have an IDE
interface in your system with a single disk drive connected to the
primary side of the interface:

```
IDE: IO=0x80 MODE=MK4
IDE0: 8-BIT LBA BLOCKS=0x00773800 SIZE=3815MB
IDE1: NO MEDIA
```

See $doc_hardware$ for a complete list of the different 
device types supported.

If you do not see drive letters assigned as expected, refer to the prior 
system boot messages to ensure media has been detected in the interface. 

Each drive letter refers back to a specific disk hardware interface like
IDE0. This is important as it is telling you what each drive letter 
refers to. 

Mass storage disks (like IDE) will normally have multiple drive letters 
assigned. The extra drive letters refer to additional "slices" on the 
disk. 

Once your system has working disk devices, they will be accessible
from any operating system you choose to run.  Disk storage is available
whether you boot your OS from ROM or from the disk media itself.

## Drive Letter Assignment

In legacy CP/M operating systems only 16 drive letters (A:-P:) available
 to be assigned to disks Drive letters were generally mapped to disk 
drives in a completely fixed way. For example, drive A: would **always**
 refer to the first floppy disk drive.

RomWBW implements a much more flexible drive letter assignment mechanism 
so that any drive letter can dynamically be assigned to any disk device, 
or slice of media.

For clarification, CP/M **cannot** refer directly to disk devices,
CP/M only understands drive letters, so to access a given disk device
it must first be assigned to a drive letter.

As the operating system starts up, you should see a list of drive letters
assigned to the disk media you have installed. 
Here is an example of the list of drive letter assignments made during
the startup of Z-System:

```
Configuring Drives...

        A:=MD0:0
        B:=MD1:0
        C:=FD0:0
        D:=FD1:0
        E:=IDE0:0
        F:=IDE0:1
        G:=IDE0:2
        H:=IDE0:3
```

Above you can see that:

- Drive A: has been assigned to MD0 which is the RAM disk device.
- Drive B: has been assigned to MD1 which is the ROM disk device.
- Drives C: and D: have been assigned to floppy disk drives.
- Drives E: thru H: have been assigned to the IDE0 hard disk device.
  The 4 entries for IDE0 are referring to the first 4 slices on that disk.

CP/M 3 and ZPM3 do not automatically display the assignments at startup,
but you can use `ASSIGN` to display them.

The assignments at boot will stay the same on each boot
as long as you do not make changes to your hardware configuration.
i.e. If you insert or remove an SD Card, CF Card or USB Stick, the drive
assignments will change at next boot.

Since drive letter assignments can change, you
must be careful when doing destructive things like using `CLRDIR` to
make sure the drive letter you use is referring to the desired media.

Drive assignments can be changed at any time, by the `ASSIGN` command.
Please see the section [Assign Drive Letters] for further details.

### Default Drive Letters

When an operating system is booted, RomWBW will automatically assign 
drive letters to disk devices. The assignment process varies depending on:

* the disk/slice you choose to boot from, and 
* the number, type, and sizes of mass storage devices available at boot

The A: drive letter is considered special by most CP/M operating systems
and is automatically used in some cases. e.g. submitting batch files, 
and is expected to be a writable volume. 

If you boot to a physical disk device, then the first drive letter (A:) 
will be assigned to the disk/slice that you are booting from,
and the rest of the drive letters will be offset to accommodate this.
By making the selected disk/slice the A: drive, you can setup different
disks/slices for specific uses and just boot it, 
and the booted operating system will be the A: drive

However when performing a ROM boot of an operating system, the first two
drive letters will be assigned to your RAM disk (A:) and your ROM disk 
(B:). This provides the maximum compatibility with CP/M.

After the first drive letter is assigned (as well as the second drive 
letter in the case of a ROM boot), RomWBW will assign additional drive 
letters based on the disk drives in the system.  Additional drive 
letters will be assigned in the following order:

- RAM Disk
- ROM Disk
- Floppy Disk(s)
- Hard Disk(s)

If a disk/slice was already assigned as the A: (or B:) drive letter, 
then it will not be assigned again.

Floppy or removable disk drives will be assigned a drive letter 
regardless of whether there is any media inserted at the time of boot.

In the case of hard disks, 1-8 drive letters will be assigned to the
initial 1-8 slices of the disk drive.  The number of drive letters
assigned to each hard disk depends on the number of hard disks in the
system:

- 1 Hard Disk: 8 drive letters (slices)
- 2 Hard Disks: 4 drive letters (slices) per disk
- 3+ Hard Disks: 2 drive letters (slices) per disk

This somewhat complicated algorithm is used to try and maximize the
limited number of operating system drive letters available (16) to
the available disk devices as evenly as possible.

For hard disk devices which are treated as non-removable media, drive 
letters will only be assigned to disk devices that actually contain 
media.  i.e. No drive letters will be assigned to an SD Card slot that 
has no SD Card inserted.

### Assign Drive Letters

The `ASSIGN` command is used to view or change the current 
drive letter mappings. Any changes made to drive letter mappings take 
immediate effect 

Refer to $doc_apps$ for more information on use of the `ASSIGN` command.

Since drive letter assignments are easily changed at any time using the
`ASSIGN` command, you can customize your assignments as desired after
starting the operating system.  Even better, you can use an auto-submit
batch file to customzie the assignments at startup without any user
intervention.

## Disk Operations/Commands

With some understanding of how RomWBW presents disk space to the
operating systems, we need to go over the options for actually setting
up your disk(s) with content.

### Preparing Media for First Use

You can initialize the media in-place using your RomWBW system.
Essentially, this means you are creating a set of blank directories on
your disk so that files can be saved there.
This is somewhat analogous to partitioning of a hard disk
or doing a low level format of a floppy disk.

Initilizing a Floppy disk is covered in the section [Floppy Disk Formatting],
or for a Hard disk the section [Hard Disk Preparation] covers the steps to 
manually setup a hard disk for first use. 

### Clearing (Formatting) Drives 

This is somewhat analogous to doing a FORMAT operation on other systems.

With RomWBW you use the `CLRDIR` command to do this.
This command is merely "clearing out" the directory space of the drive
referred to by a drive letter and setting up the new empty directory.

Refer to $doc_apps$ for more information on use of the `CLRDIR` command.

Since `CLRDIR` works on drive letters, make
absolutely sure you know what media and slice are assigned to that
drive letter before using `CLRDIR` because `CLRDIR` will wipe out any
pre-existing contents of the slice.

After `CLRDIR` completes, the slice should be ready to use by the operating
system via the drive letter assigned.
Start by using the `DIR` command on the drive.
This should return without error, but list no files.

Here is an example of using `CLRDIR`.  In this example, the `ASSIGN`
command is used to show the current drive letter assignments.  Then
the `CLRDIR` command is used to initialize the directory of drive 'G'
which is slice 2 of hard disk device IDE0 ("IDE0:2").

```
B>ASSIGN

   A:=MD0:0
   B:=MD1:0
   C:=FD0:0

```

### Checking Disk Layout

If you are not sure which disk layout is used for your existing
media, you can use the CP/M 2.2 `STAT` command to display information
including the number of "32  Byte Directory Entries"
for a drive letter on the corresponding hard disk.  

- If it indicates 512, your disk layout is legacy (hd512).  
- If it indicates 1024, your disk layout is modern (hd1k).

Here is an example of checking the disk layout.  

```
B>STAT E:DSK:

    E: Drive Characteristics
65408: 128 Byte Record Capacity
 8176: Kilobyte Drive  Capacity
 1024: 32  Byte Directory Entries
    0: Checked  Directory Entries
  256: Records/ Extent
   32: Records/ Block
   64: Sectors/ Track
    2: Reserved Tracks
```

It is critical that you include `DSK:` after the drive letter in the
`STAT` command line.  The important line to look at is labeled "32 Byte
Directory Entries".

# Disk Types

## RAM & ROM Disks

A typical RomWBW system has 512KB of ROM and 512KB of RAM.  Some
portions of each are dedicated to loading and running applications
and operating system.  The space left over is available for an
operating system to use as a pseudo-disk device (ROM Disk and RAM
Disk).

Unlike other types of disk devices, ROM and RAM Disks do not contain an
actual operating system and are not "bootable".  However, they are
accessible to any operating system (whether the operating system is
loaded from ROM or a different disk device).

Neither RAM nor ROM disks require explicit formatting or initialization.
ROM disks are pre-formatted and RAM disks are formatted automatically
with an empty directory when first used.

#### RAM Disk

The RAM disk provides a small CP/M filesystem that you can use for the
temporary storage of files. Unless your system has a battery backed
mechanism for persisting your RAM contents, the RAM disk contents will
be lost at each power-off. 

The RAM disk is an excellent
choice for storing temporary files because it is very fast.  You will
notice that the first time an operating system is started after the
power was turned off, you will see a message indicating that the
RAM disk is being formatted.  If you reset your system without
turning off power, the RAM disk will not be reformatted and it's
contents will still be intact.

#### ROM Disk

Like the RAM disk, the ROM disk also provides a small CP/M
filesystem, but it's contents are static -- they are part of the
ROM. As such, you cannot save files to the ROM disk. Any attempt to
do this will result in a disk I/O error. 

The contents of the ROM
disk have been chosen to provide a core set of tools and
applications that are helpful for either CP/M 2.2 or ZSDOS. Since
ZSDOS is CP/M 2.2 compatible, this works fairly well. However, you
will find some files on the ROM disk that will work with ZSDOS, but
will not work on CP/M 2.2. For example, `LDDS`, which loads the
ZSDOS date/time stamper will only run under ZSDOS.

#### Flash ROM Disks

The limitation of ROM disks being read-only can be overcome on some
platforms with the appropriate selection of Flash ROM chip and
system configuration. In this case the flash-file system can be
enabled which will allow the ROM disk to be read and written to.
Flash devices have a limited write lifespan and continual usage will
eventually wear out the device. It is not suited for high usage
applications.  Enabling ROM disk writing requires building a
custom ROM.

## Floppy Disks

If your system has the appropriate hardware, RomWBW will support the use
of floppy disks.  The supported floppy disk formats are generally
derived from the IBM PC floppy disk formats:

* 5.25" 360K Double-sided, Double-density
* 5.25" 1.2M Double-sided, High-density
* 3.5" 720K Double-sided, Double-density
* 3.5" 1.44M Double-sided, High-density

When supported, RomWBW is normally configured for 2 3.5" floppy disk drives.
If a high-density disk drive is used, then RomWBW automatically detects and
adapts to double-density or high-density media.  It cannot automatically
detect 3.5" vs. 5.25" disk drive types -- the ROM must be pre-configured
for the disk drive type.

**WARNING:** Some of the operating systems provided with RomWBW require
that a soft-reset be performed when swapping floppy disk media.  For
example, under CP/M 2.2, you must press control-C at the CP/M prompt
after inserting a new floppy disk.  The consequences of failing to
perform the soft-reset vary from unexpected error messages to full
disk directory corruption.

## Hard Disks

The concept of a hard disk in RomWBW applies to any
storage device that provides at least 8MB of space.  The actual
media can be a real spinning hard disk, a CompactFlash Card, a
SD Card, etc.  In this document, the term hard disk will apply
equally to all of these.

The vintage operating systems included with RomWBW were produced at a
time when mass storage devices were quite small. CP/M 2.2 could only
handle filesystems up to 8MB.

Since storage devices today are quite large, RomWBW implements a
mechanism called slicing (see [Hard Disk Slices]) to allow 
up to 256 8MB CP/M filesystems on a single large storage device,
where each slice can be assigned to a drive letter in CPM, 
and be treated as its own hard disk drive (from a CPM perspective).

In order to achieve compatibility across all of the operating systems 
supported by RomWBW, the hard disk filesystem format used is 8MB. This 
ensures any filesystem will be accessible to any of the operating 
systems.

RomWBW uses Logical Block Addressing (LBA) to interact with all hard
disks.  The RomWBW operating systems use older Cylinder/Head/Sector
(CHS) addressing.  To accommodate the operating systems, RomWBW emulates
CHS addressing.  Specifically, it makes all hard disks look like they
have 16 sectors and 16 heads.  The number of tracks varies with the size
of the physical hard disk.

### Hard Disk Layouts

When RomWBW uses a hard disk, it utilizes an area of the physical hard 
disk drive space to store a sequential series of slices that contain the
actual CP/M filesystems referred to by drive letters by the operating 
system.

Two hard disk layout schemes exist:

* Modern (hd1k)
* Legacy (hd512)

You **cannot** mix disk layouts on a single disk device, 
however It is perfectly fine for one system to have
multiple hard disks with different layouts -- each physical disk
device is handled separately.

If you are setting up a new disk, the modern (hd1k) layout is
recommended for the following reasons:

* Larger number of directory entries per filesystem
* Simplifies creation of coresident FAT filesystem
* Reduces chances of data corruption
* Each slice occupies exactly 8MB (an exact power of 2) in size

Both the legacy and modern disk layouts continue to be fully supported
by RomWBW.  There are no plans to deprecate the legacy layout.  

#### Modern Layout

RomWBW (Starting with v3.2) supports the use of disk partitioning, 
utilising a Master Boot Record (MBR) partition tables.
The Wikipedia article on the
[Master Boot Record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record)
is excellent if you are not familiar with them. 

RomWBW uses the partition type id `0x2E`. This partition type id 
does not equate to any existing well-known
partition types -- it was chosen because it is not generally used.
RomWBW does not support extended partitions -- only a single
primary partition can be used.

The existence of a partition table entry for RomWBW on
a hard disk makes it behave in the modern mode. Removing the RomWBW 
partition entry from a modern hard disk layout 
will cause the existing data to be unavailable and/or corrupted

The CP/M filesystem in the slices of the modern disk layout 
contain 1024 directory entries.

#### Legacy Layout

Originally, RomWBW always used the very start of the hard disk media
for the location of the slices.  In this layout, slice 0 referred to
the first chunk of ~8MB on the disk, slice 1 referred to the second
chunk of ~8MB on the disk, and so on. The number of slices is limited
to the size of the disk media -- if you attempted to read/write to a
slice that would exceed the disk size, you would see I/O errors. 

The legacy format takes steps to allow a partition table to still be
used for other types of filesystems such as DOS/FAT.  It just does not
use a partition table entry to determine the start of the RomWBW slices.

The lack of a RomWBW partition table entry will cause legacy behaviour.
Adding a partition table entry on an existing legacy RomWBW hard disk 
will cause the existing data to be unavailable and/or corrupted.

The CP/M filesystem in the slices of the legacy disk layout 
contain 512 directory entries.

### Hard Disk Slices

RomWBW implements a mechanism called slicing to allow multiple CP/M 
filesystem on a single large storage device. To say it another way, the 
media is "sliced up" into many CP/M filesystems.

You cannot use slices on any media less than 8MB in size.
Specifically, you cannot slice RAM disks, ROM disks, floppy
disks, etc.  All of these are considered to have a single slice (0)

It is very important to understand that RomWBW slices are not
individually created or allocated on your hard disk.
RomWBW uses a single partition on your hard disk to contain
the slices. You should think of slices as just an index into a
sequential set of 8MB areas that exist in this partition.

RomWBW allows up to up to 256 slices each of 8MB in size on a single 
large storage device. This allows the use of up to 2GB of usable space 
on one media device.

It is possible to create other partitions (typically FAT), for now, we
are just talking about the slices within the single RomWBW partition.

### Slice Assignment

When assigning Hard disks to drive letters you also need to assign the 
slice.

Referring to slices within a storage device is done by appending a
`:<n>` where \<n\> is the device relative slice number from 0-255.
For example, if you have an IDE device, it will show up as IDE0: in the
boot messages meaning the first IDE device. To refer to the fourth slice
of IDE0, you would type "IDE0:3". Here are some examples:

|          |                              |
|----------|------------------------------|
| `IDE0:0` | First slice of disk in IDE0  |
| `IDE0:`  | First slice of disk in IDE0  |
| `IDE0:3` | Fourth slice of disk in IDE0 |

So, if you wanted to use drive letter L: to refer to the fourth slice of
IDE0, you could use the command `ASSIGN L:=IDE0:3`. There are a couple
of rules to be aware of when assigning drive letters. First, you may
only refer to a specific device/slice with one drive letter at a time.
Said another way, you cannot have multiple drive letters referring to a
the same device/slice at the same time. Second, there must always be a
drive assigned to A:. Any attempt to violate these rules will be blocked
by the `ASSIGN` command.

As you see, the name of a slice does not reference the hard disk
partition containing the slices.  Since there can only be a single
RomWBW partition containing slices on any disk, the partition is
determined automatically.

RomWBW does not prevent you from assigning slices
to drive letters even if the location of the slice does not fit on the
physical disk.  Any attempt to access a drive letter mapped to a slice
that does not fit will result in an error such as "no disk" from the
operating system.

For example, a 64MB CF Card (which is typically a bit smaller
than 64MB) will only fit 7 slices.  At startup, you will typically see
8 drive letters assigned to the CF Card.  Attempting to access the
last drive letter will result in a "no disk" error from the operating
system.

### Hard Disk Capacity

The exact number of CP/M filesystem slices that will fit on your
specific physical hard disk can be determined as follows:

- For modern (hd1k) disk layouts, it is 1024KB + (slices * 8192KB). 
  Or equivalent to say 1MB + (slices * 8MB).
- For legacy (hd512) disk layouts, it is slices * 8,320KB.

**WARNING**: In this document KB means 1024 bytes and MB means 1048576
bytes (frequently expressed as KiB and MiB in modern terminology).
In general, hard disk capacities use KB to mean 1000 bytes and MB
to mean 1,000,000 bytes.

As an example, A "64MB" CF Card probably has
less than 62.5MB of actual space (using the RomWBW definition that
1MB is 1048576 bytes).  Such a drive will not support 8 slices.  It
will support 7 slices just fine because 
1024KB + (7 * 8192MB) = 57MB (hd1k) or
7 * 8,320KB = 58.24MB (hd512)

Although you can use up to 256 slices per physical disk,
equating to 2GB of storage this large number of slices is rarely used.
It is recommended that hard disk media used with RomWBW be 1GB or
greater in capacity.
This will support the RomWBW Combo Disk Image (see [Combo Hard Disk Image])
that allows you to use 64 CP/M filesystem slices and a 384KB FAT filesystem.

# Disk Preparation

There are two approaches to preparing disks for use by RomWBW.

- **Manual**: Use RomWBW itself to format empty disks and then transfer
  files over to the disks.
- **Images**: Use a modern computer to write a pre-built disk image
  including files to a disk.

This section of the document describes the manual process of preparing
empty disks that are ready for use by an operating system. 

Alternatively, you can use the pre-built RomWBW disk images to quickly
create disk media that already has a large selection of files and
bootable operating system slices.  Using images to prepare a disk
is documented in [Disk Images].  You do not need to follow the
instructions in this section if you want to use disk images.

## Floppy Disk Formatting

Floppy media must be physically formatted before it can be used.  This
is normally accomplished by using the supplied Floppy Disk Utility `FDU`
application. This application interacts directly with your hardware
and therefore you must specify your floppy interface hardware at
application startup. Additionally, you need to specify the floppy disk drive
and media format to use for formatting.

Refer to $doc_apps$ for more information on use of the `FDU` command.

Since the physical format of floppy media is the same as that used
in a standard MS-DOS/Windows computer, you can also format
floppy disk media in a standard computer.  However there are caveats:

*  The directory format itself will **NOT** be compatible with CP/M OSes.
   You **WILL** need to use the `CLRDIR` command to reformat the directory area
   from CP/M. See section [Clearing (Formatting) Drives]
*  FDU allows you to specify physical sector interleaving (defaults to 2)
   which will result in faster floppy disk I/O. 
   Formatting on a modern computer may not optimize this. 

Below is a sample session using `FDU` to format a 1.44M floppy disk in
the first (primary) floppy disk drive:

You can confirm a floppy disk is ready for content by simply running a `DIR`
command on it.  The `DIR` command should complete without error and
should list no files.

## Hard Disk Preparation

This section deals with initializing hard disk media entirely from
your RomWBW system. The following instructions are one way to proceed.
This does not mean to imply it is the only possible way.  

First you need to understand

*  The disk layout approach (either hd1k or the legacy hd512). 
   See [Hard Disk Layouts] section if you are not sure. 
   hd1k should be the preferred layout.
*  The number of 8MB slices that you want to allocate, preferred is 64 slices.
   At least 1 slice of 8MB is required
*  If you want to leave space for a FAT partition. See [FAT Filesystem Preparation]
*  The total capacity of your drive, to hold the CP/M (and other) partition(s)

Then you will need to start by inserting the disk media,
booting RomWBW, and confirming that the media is being recognized.
If RomWBW recognizes the media, it will indicate this in the
boot messages even though the media may not yet been prepared for use.

Then launch either CP/M 2.2 or Z-System from ROM using the
Boot Loader `C` or `Z` commands respectively.
You can now use the tools on the ROM disk to prepare your disks.

Note that you may see the operating system assign disks/slices to
drives letters even though the disks/slices are not yet initialized.  This is
normal and does not mean the disks/slices are ready to use.

### Partition Setup

To setup a partition you must run the `FDISK80` utility.
After FDISK80 starts, enter the disk unit number of the new media.
The disk unit number was assigned at boot See [Device Unit Assignments]

Refer to $doc_apps$ for more information on use of the `FDISK80` utility. 

If you want to use the legacy hd512 layout skip down to the [Legacy (hd512)] section

#### Modern (hd1k)

At this point, use the `I` command to initialize (reset)
the partition table to an empty state.

You must create a partition for the RomWBW CP/M slices. 
Then create a partition using the `N` command. Importantly:

*  The partition number should typically be `1` the first partition
*  The partition can be placed anywhere you want, 
   The typical location for the RomWBW partition is at 1MB. 
*  The partition size should be the total size of all the slices you require, 
   and must be at least 8MB in size, in increments of 8MB makes sense.

You **must** then set the type of partition to `2E` using the `T` command.
The `P` command can be used to display the partition before it is written
Finally the partition can be written to disk using the `W` write command.

**WARNING**: Modifying the partition table of existing media will
make any data on the media inaccessible.

Below is an example of creating a RomWBW
partition following these guidelines.

```

>>w
Do you really want to write to disk? [N/y]: y
Okay
FDISK exit.
```

At this point, it is best to restart your system to make sure that
the operating system is aware of the partition table updates.  Start
CP/M 2.2 or Z-System from ROM again.

#### Legacy (hd512)

At this point, use the `I` command to initialize (reset) 
the partition table to an empty state.

To use the hd512 layout, use `W` to write the empty table to the disk 
and exit.  Remember that the lack of a partition for RomWBW implies the 
legacy (hd512) layout.

At this point, it is best to restart your system to make sure that
the operating system is aware of the partition table updates.  Start
CP/M 2.2 or Z-System from ROM again.

#### FAT Partition

At this point you may want to consider creating a FAT partition
Please see the section [FAT Filesystem Preparation] for detils on how
to setup the FAT partition.

### Slice Initialization

You need to initialize each slice for CP/M to use it. 
This is somewhat analogous to doing a FORMAT operation on other systems,
and is done using the `CLRDIR` command. 

This is covered in the section [Clearing (Formatting) Drives]

**WARNING**: Earlier versions of the `CLRDIR` application do not
appear to check for disk errors when it runs.  If you attempt to run
`CLRDIR` on a drive that is mapped to a slice that does not actually fit
on the physical disk, it may behave erratically.

Assuming you want to use additional slices, you should initialize them
using the same process.  You may need to reassign drive letters to
access some slices that are beyond the ones automatically assigned.
You can use the `ASSIGN` command to handle this.

## Post Disk Preparation

Once a disk (either floppy or hard disk) has been initialised and 
formattted you may optionally;
* Make the disk bootable
* Copy system (or other) files to the disk

### Making a Disk Bootable

To make a disk bootable you will need to follow the specific instructions
in [Operating Systems], as each operating system will be different.

Generally you will need to use `SYSCOPY` to setup the system track(s) 
of the disk.As an example, If you wanted to setup C: as a bootable 
Z-System disk you would use:

```

Once this process succeeds, you will be able to boot directly to the
disk slice from the boot loader prompt. See the instructions in
[Starting Operating Systems from Disk] for details on this.

### Copying System Files

As well as making the disk bootable, you may need to transfer other
system and application files to your disks.
Refer to [Transferring Files] for more information on getting
files onto your disks.

# Disk Images

Since it would be quite a bit of work to transfer over all the files you
might want initially to your disk(s), It is generally easier to use 
these disk images than transferring your files over individually. RomWBW
comes with a variety of ready to use disk images.

You can use your modern
Windows, Linux, or Mac computer to copy a disk image onto the disk
media, then just move the media over to your RomWBW computer.

The disk image files are found in the Binary directory of the
distribution. 

Each disk image has the complete set of normal applications and tools
distributed with the associated operating system or application suite.
The following table shows the disk images available.

| **Disk Image**    | **Description**                      | **Boot** |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|----------|
| xxx_aztec.img     | Aztec C Compiler                     | No       |
| xxx_bascomp.img   | Microsoft Basic-80 Compiler          | No       |
| xxx_blank.img     | _empty image_                        | No       |
| xxx_cowgol.img    | Cowgol 2.0 Compiler                  | No       |
| xxx_cpm22.img     | DRI CP/M 2.2 Operating System        | Yes      |
| xxx_cpm3.img      | DRI CP/M 3 Operating System          | Yes      |

| xxx_nzcom.img     | NZCOM ZCPR 3.4 Operating System      | Yes      |
| xxx_qpm.img       | QPM Operating System                 | Yes      |
| xxx_tpascal.img   | Borland Turbo Pascal Compiler        | No       |
| xxx_ws4.img       | WordStar v4 & ZDE Applications       | No       |

| xxx_zpm3.img      | ZPM3 Operating System                | Yes      |
| xxx_zsdos.img     | ZCPR-DJ & ZSDOS 1.1 Operating System | Yes      |

You will find 3 sets of these .img files in the distribution.  The
"xxx" portion of the filename will be:

*  "fd_" for a floppy image.
*  "hd1k_" for a modern layout hard disk image.
*  "hd512_" for a legacy layout hard disk image.

In the case of xxx_dos65.img, only an hd512 variant is provided.  This
is a constraint of the DOS65 distribution.

There is also an image file called "psys.img" which contains a bootable
p-System hard disk image.  It contains 6 p-System filesystem slices, but
these are not interoperable with the CP/M slices described above.  This
file is discussed separately under [UCSD p-System] in Operating Systems
section.

## Floppy Disk Images

The floppy disk images are all intended to be used with 3.5" high-density,
double-sided 1.44 MB floppy disk media.  This is ideal for the default
floppy disk drive support included in RomWBW standard ROMs.

For floppy disks, the .img file is written directly to the floppy media
as is.  The floppy .img files are 1.44 MB which is the exact size of a
single 3.5" high density floppy disk.  You will need a floppy disk
drive of the same type connected to your modern computer to write this
image.  Although modern computers do not come equipped with a floppy disk
drive, you can still find USB floppy drives that work well for this.

The floppy disk must be physically formatted **before** writing the
image onto it.  You can do this with RomWBW using `FDU` as described
in the [Floppy Disk Formatting] section of this document.
While you can also format the floppy using your modern computer, 
using `FDU` is preferable.

RomWBW includes a Windows application called RawWriteWin in the Tools
directory of the distribution.  This simple application will let you
choose a file and write it to an attached floppy disk drive. For Linux/MacOS,
I think you can use the dd command (but I have not actually tried
this).  It is probably obvious, but writing an image to a floppy disk
will overwrite and destroy all previous contents.

Once the image has been written to the floppy disk, you can insert
the floppy disk in your RomWBW floppy disk and read/write files
on it according to the specific operating system instructions.  If the
image is bootable, then you will be able to boot from it by entering
the floppy disk drive's corresponding unit number at the RomWBW Boot Loader
command prompt.

## Hard Disk Images

Keeping in mind that a RomWBW hard disk (including CF/SD/USB devices)
allows you to have multiple slices (CP/M filesystems), there are a
couple ways to image hard disk media. The easiest approach is to 
use the Combo Disk Image.  This hard disk image is already prepared
with 6 slices containing 5 ready-to-run OSes and a slice with
the WordStar application files.  

Alternatively, you can create your own hard disk image with the specific
slice contents you choose.

### Standard Hard Disk Layout

As previously described in [Hard Disk Layouts], the exact placement of
slices and optional FAT partition will vary depending on which disk
layout (hd512 or hd1k) you are using and your partition table entries.
To simplify the use of hard disk images, RomWBW has adopted a standard
partition layout for disk image files provided.  This standard
layout is used to produce the Combo Disk Images described below.

These partition sizes and locations were chosen to:

- Fit entirely on 1GB media
- Allow for 64 CP/M filesystem slices
- Allow for a 384KB FAT filesystem

The standard partition table table entries are:

+---------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+
|                                 | **--- Modern (hd1k) ---**     | **--- Legacy (hd512) ---**    |
|                                 +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
|                                 | Byte(s)       | Sector(s)     | Byte(s)       | Sector(s)     |
+=================================+==============:+==============:+==============:+==============:+
| RomWBW Partition Start          | 1 MB          | 2,048         | --            | --            |
+---------------------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| RomWBW Partition Size           | 512 MB        | 1,048,576     | --            | --            |
+---------------------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| FAT Filesystem Start            | 513 MB        | 1,050,624     | 520 MB        | 1,064,960     |
+---------------------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| FAT Filesystem Size             | 384 MB        | 786,432       | 384 MB        | 786,432       |
+---------------------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| \<end\>                         | 897 MB        | 1,851,392     | 904 MB        | 1,837,056     |
+---------------------------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+

**NOTE:** RomWBW is not limited to these partition table entries.  You
can change the size and location of the RomWBW and/or FAT partitions to
increase/decrease the number of slices or FAT filesystem size.  Doing
so would require using `FDISK80` to define your own custom disk layout
and initializing your filesystems manually.

The $doc_sys$ has more information on the standard disk layouts as
implemented in the Combo Disk Images.  Additionally, there is a document
called "Hard Disk Anatomy.pdf" in the Doc directory of the RomWBW
distribution with detailed information on the standard disk
layouts.

### Combo Hard Disk Image

The Combo Disk Image is essentially just a single disk image that has
several of the individual filesystem images (slices) already
concatenated together using the standard disk layout described above.
The Combo Disk Image includes the partition table of the standard disk
layout and the following 6 slices in the positions indicated:

| **Slice**  | **Description**                         |
|------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Slice 0    | DRI CP/M 2.2 Operating System           |
| Slice 1    | ZCPR-DJ & ZSDOS 1.1 Operating System    |
| Slice 2    | NZCOM ZCPR 3.4 Operating System         |
| Slice 3    | DRI CP/M 3 Operating System             |
| Slice 4    | ZPM3 Operating System                   |
| Slice 5    | WordStar v4 & ZDE Applications          |
| Slice 6-63 | _blank unformatted_                     |

There are actually 2 Combo Disk Images in the
distribution.  One for an hd512 disk layout (hd512_combo.img) and one
for an hd1k disk layout (hd1k_combo.img). Simply use the image file that
corresponds to your desired hard disk layout.  Review the information
in [Hard Disk Layouts] if you need more information of the disk layout
options.

> **Note**: Apart from the hd512 and hd1k Combo Disk Images (mentioned above)
> there are actually a number of other `hd1k_*_combo.img` files. These
> additional combo files are platform (generally romless) specific,
> and should be ignored unless you are on one of these platforms.
> If you are on one of these platforms you must use the correct combo file

The Combo Disk Image actually only contains the initial partition table,
and the first 6 slices (Slice 0 to 5), this is approximately 49MB in
size. While the partition table reserves space to store 64 CP/M
filesystem slices as well as a single 384MB FAT filesystem, these areas
remain empty, and must be initialized manually using `CLRDIR` for CP/M
filesystems and `FAT FORMAT` for the FAT filesystem.

#### Combo Disk Image Capacity

The standard hard disk layout used by the Combo Disk Image was designed
to fit well on a 1GB hard disk. The 64 CP/M slices (approximately 512MB)
and 384MB FAT filesystem all fit well within a 1GB hard disk.  This
size choice was a bit arbitrary, but based on the idea that 1GB
CF/SD/USB Media is easy and cheap to acquire.

It is fine if your hard disk is smaller than 1GB.  It just means that it
will not be possible to use the pre-allocated FAT filesystem partition
and any CP/M filesystem slices that don't fit. The true number of CP/M
filesystem slices that will fit on your specific physical hard disk can
be calculated as described in [Hard Disk Capacity].

If you attempt to access a slice past the end of the physical hard disk
you will get "no disk" errors. You should calculate the maximum number
of slices your hard disk will support and do not exceed this number.

#### Combo Disk Image Advice

A great way to maintain your own data on a hard disk is to put your data
in slices beyond the first 6.  By doing so, you can always "re-image"
your drive media with the Combo Disk Image without overlaying the data
stored in the slices beyond the first 6.  Just be very careful to use
the same combo image layout (hd512 or hd1k) as you used originally.

### Custom Hard Disk Image

For hard disks, each .img file represents a single slice (CP/M
filesystem).  Since a hard disk can contain many slices, you can just
concatenate the slices (.img files) together to create your desired hard
disk image.

If you look in the Binary directory of the distribution, you will see
that there are more disk (slice) images than the 6 that are included in
the Combo Disk Images.  These supplemental disk images are identified by
looking for the files that start with hd1k_ or hd512_.

#### Adding Slices to Combo Image

You can add slices to the Combo Disk Images simply by tacking
slices onto the end.  For example, if you want to add a slice
containing the MSX ROMs to the end of the combo image, you could
use one of the following command lines depending on your operating
system:

Windows:

`COPY /B hd1k_combo.img + hd1k_msxroms.img my_hd.img` 

Linus/MaxOS:

`cat hd1k_combo.img hd1k_msxroms.img >my_hd.img`

Note that you **must** be sure to use either the hd1k_ or hd512_
prefixed files together.  You cannot mix them.

#### Creating a new Custom Image

If you want to create a completely custom hard disk image that is not
based on the existing combo image, you can generate a disk image entirely
from scratch using whatever slices you want in whatever order you like.

For example, if you want to create a hard disk image that 
has slices for CP/M 2.2, CP/M 3, and WordStar in the hd512 format, you 
would use the command line of your modern computer to create the final 
image:

Windows:

`COPY /B hd512_cpm22.img + hd512_cpm3.img + hd512_ws hd.img`

Linux/MacOS:

`cat hd512_cpm22.img hd512_cpm3.img hd512_ws >hd.img`

**NOTE:** For the hd1k disk layout, you **must** prepend the 
prefix file called hd1k_prefix.dat which contains the required
partition table.  So, for an hd1k layout you would use the following:

Windows:

`COPY /B hd1k_prefix.dat + hd1k_cpm22.img + hd1k_cpm3.img + hd1k_ws hd.img`

Linux/MacOS:

`cat hd1k_prefix.dat hd1k_cpm22.img hd1k_cpm3.img hd1k_ws >hd.img`

> **Note**: Apart from the hd1k_prefix.dat file (mentioned above)
> there are actaully a number of other `hd1k_*_prefix.dat` files. These
> additional prefix files are platform (generally romless) specific,
> and should be ignored unless you are on one of these platforms.
> If you are on one of these platforms you must use the correct prefix file

In all of the examples above, the resulting file (hd.img) would now be 
written to your hard disk media and would be ready to use in a RomWBW 
system.

If you wish to further customize or create new disk image definitions,
please refer to the ReadMe.txt file in the Source/Images directory.

### Writing Hard Disk Images

Once you have chosen a Combo Hard Disk Image file or prepared your own 
custom hard disk image file, it will need to be written to the media 
using your modern computer.  When using this method, 
the disk will be partitioned and setup with 1 or more slices containing 
ready-to-run bootable operating systems. 

To write a hard disk image file onto your actual media (actual hard disk
or CF/SD/USB Media), you need to use an image writing utility on your 
modern computer. Your modern computer will need to have an appropriate 
interface or slot that accepts the media. To actually copy the image 

* On Linux or MacOS , you can use the `dd` command. 
* On Windows, in the "Tools" directory of the distribution, there is
  an application called Win32DiskImager. 
 
In all cases, the image file should be written to the 
media starting at the very first block or sector of the media.
This is the default behaviour on all software.

To be entirely clear, writing a disk image file to your hard disk media
will overwrite an pre-existing partition table and the number of slices
that your image file contains.  It will not overwrite or corrupt slices
beyond those in the image file.  As a result, you can use additional
slices as a place to maintain your personal data because these slices
will survive re-imaging of the media.  If you setup a FAT partition
on your media, it will also survive the imaging process.

#### Media Usage and Initialization

Once you have copied the image onto the hard disk media, you can
move the media over to your RomWBW system.  You can then boot to the
operating system slices by specifying (***\<diskunit\>.\<slice\>***) at the
RomWBW Boot Loader command prompt.
See the section [Starting Operating Systems from Disk] for further details

You are not limited to the number of slices that are contained in the
image that you write to your hard disk media.  You can use additional
slices as long your media has room for them.

However, writing the disk image will not initialize the additional slices.
You will need to use the `CLRDIR` application to initialize
any un-initialized slice before its first use, 
and and optionally `SYSCOPY` if you want th slice to be bootable.
If you use the combo image this applies to slices 6 thru 63.
The procedure for this is documented in the
[Clearing (Formatting) Drives] section.

Likewise, the pre-allocated FAT partition must still be formatted using 
`FAT FORMAT` in order to actually use it (see [FAT Filesystem Preparation]).
Alternatively, the FAT partition can be formatted on a modern computer.

#### Re-Imaging Existing Media

In order for your additional slices and/or FAT partition to
survive re-imaging, you **must** follow these rules:

* Do not modify the partition table of the media using FDISK80 or any
  other partition management tools.
* Ensure that your hard disk image file uses the same disk layout
  approach (hd512 or hd1k) as previously used on the media.

### Writing Hard Disk Slices

This section covers techniques to copy partial images onto pre-existing media,
in effect performing a selective slice copy. These techniques currently **only** apply to 
hd1k formatted media, which has a partition table entry, and a convenient 1MB size metric. 
However adapting to hd512 is possible, but left to the user.

You will need to have access to a Linux/MacOS machine, or have the
Linux tools for Windows installed, including the `dd` command line tool.
For Windows there are multiple options for installing `dd` including
[MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), [CygWin](https://www.cygwin.com/),
and [dd for Windows](http://www.chrysocome.net/dd).

**WARNING**: The `dd` command is a low-level utility that writes
directly to raw disk sectors with almost no safety checks.  It is very
easy to corrupt a disk if this tool is used incorrectly.

The `dd` command supports options to define precisely source 
and destination offsets and sizes to copy.
From the documentation of `dd` the following options are important.

```
     if=file  Read input from file instead of the standard input.
     of=file  Write output to file instead of the standard output.  
     skip=n   Skip n blocks from the beginning of the input before
              copying. 
     seek=n   Seek n blocks from the beginning of the output before
              copying.
     count=n  Copy only n input blocks.
     bs=n     Set both input and output block size to n bytes instead
              of the default 512
 ```

The best approach is to copy data to the RomWBW partition. To do this, you
must first determine the name that your operating system is using for the
RomWBW disk and partition. An easy way to determine this may be the linux `mount`
command, which lists the currently mounted partitions. From here you can more easily 
determine the naming scheme used by your operating system.

Typically disk devices are named something like `/dev/disk9` or `/dev/sdg`, noting above
the `g` is a alphabetic and it could be any letter. This naming is arbitrary
and depend on the operating system, and the specific hardware connecting the device

Partitions are typically named by simply adding a number after the name of the hard disk
device.  For example, the first partition could be `/dev/disk9s1`, `/dev/sdg1`, or `/dev/sdgp1`.

In the following examples we use the above `dd` options, noting the `of=` option
is the RomWBW target partition.

** NOTE ** A second approach (Examples 3 and 4) is to address the hard
disk as a raw disk device and we take explicit steps to calculate the
start of the RomWBW partition. While this works, it is better to use the
partition relative approach.

The commands in the examples below are run from the `Binary` folder of RomWBW distribution.

#### Example 1 : Copy the Games image to an empty slice of our media

In this example we will copy the (hd1k) games image to Slice 6 (free)
of our existing media. In this example we assume the media
has already been formatted with the combo image, which already
contains 6 slices (numbered from 0 to 5).
We are just copying the needed slice to the existing media
as a new slice (number 6) after the existing slices making it the 7th slice.

```
Binary % sudo dd if=hd1k_games.img of=/dev/sdg1 seek=6 bs=8M

Password:

1+0 records in
1+0 records out
8388608 bytes transferred in 1.917296 secs (4375228 bytes/sec)
```

Since bs=8MB the `seek=6` skips the first 6 (8MB slices) slices (in the target image)
and writes the games image to the 7th slice.

#### Example 2 : Copy the entire Combo Image without replacing partition table

In all of the following examples we use `bs=1MB` to defines the block size used
in other parameters. This is convenient since the combo image reserves 1MB for
the partition table at the start of the disk.

In this example we will copy the (hd1k) combo image (which includes a partition table) 
over our media without replacing the partition table. In this example we assume the media
has already been formatted with the combo image, and we have modified the partition table, 
which we do not want to overwrite.

```
Binary % sudo dd if=hd1k_combo.img of=/dev/sdg1 skip=1 bs=1M

Password:

48+0 records in
48+0 records out
50331648 bytes transferred in 11.503776 secs (4745528 bytes/sec)
```

The `skip=1` skips the first 1MB (partition table) in the input file, 
effectively stripping out the combo images partition table, before overwriting 
the slices in the target partition.

#### Example 3 : Copy the Combo Image without replacing partition table

This example is identical to Example 2 except it writes to the target 
disk device itself (`of=/dev/disk9`), not the target partition.

```
Binary % sudo dd if=hd1k_combo.img of=/dev/disk9 skip=1 seek=1 bs=1M

Password:

48+0 records in
48+0 records out
50331648 bytes transferred in 11.503776 secs (4745528 bytes/sec)
```

The `skip=1` skips the first 1MB in the input file, and likewise 
`seek=1` skips the first 1MB of the target media file we are writing to,
thus in effect we are skipping the first 1MB,  which contains the 
partition table itself.

#### Example 4 : Copy the Games image to an empty slice of our media

In this example we will copy the (hd1k) games image to Slice 6 (free)
of our existing media. In this example we assume the media 
has already been formatted with the combo image, which already 
contains 6 slices (numbered from 0 to 5)
We are just coping the needed slice to this existing media
as a new slice (number 6) after the existing slices making it the 7th slice.

```
Binary % sudo dd if=hd1k_games.img of=/dev/disk9 seek=49 bs=1M

Password:

8+0 records in
8+0 records out
8388608 bytes transferred in 1.917296 secs (4375228 bytes/sec)
```

The `seek=49` skips the first 49MB of the media file we are writing to.
49 is calculated as `(slice number * 8) + 1`, 
where 8 is the size of a slice 
and 1 is the size of the partition table im megabytes.
Thus we are skipping 6 slices (in the combo image) 
and writing to the 7th slice.

# Operating Systems

One of the primary goals of RomWBW is to expose a set of generic
hardware functions that make it easy to adapt operating systems to
any hardware supported by RomWBW. As a result, there are now 8
operating systems that have been adapted to run under RomWBW. The
adaptations are identical for all hardware supported by RomWBW
because RomWBW hides all hardware specifics from the operating system.

By design, the operating systems provided with RomWBW are original and 
unmodified from their original distribution.  Patches published by the 
authors are generally included or applied.  The various enhancements 
RomWBW provides (such as hard disk slices) are implemented entirely 
within the system adaptation component of each operating system (e.g.,
CP/M CBIOS).  As a result, each operating system should function
exactly as documented by the authors and retain maximum compatibility
with original applications.

Note that all of the operating systems included with RomWBW support the 
same basic filesystem format from DRI CP/M 2.2 (except for p-System). As
a result, a formatted filesystem will be accessible to any operating 
system. The only possible issue is that if you turn on date/time 
stamping using the newer OSes, the older OSes will not understand this. 
The older OS will not corrupt the files, but the date/time stamps will
not be maintained.

The following sections briefly describe the operating system options
currently available and brief operating notes.

## Digital Research CP/M 2.2

This is the most widely used variant of the Digital Research
operating systems. It has the most basic feature set, but is
essentially the compatibility metric for all other CP/M-like
operating systems including those listed below.

If you are new to the CP/M world, I would recommend using this CP/M 
variant to start with simply because it is the most stable and you are 
less likely to encounter compatibility issues.

#### Documentation

* [CPM Manual]($doc_root$/CPM/CPM Manual.pdf)

#### Boot Disk

To make a bootable CP/M disk, use the RomWBW `SYSCOPY` tool
to place a copy of the operating system on the boot track of
the disk.  The RomWBW ROM disk has a copy of the boot track
call "CPM.SYS".  For example:

`SYSCOPY C:=B:CPM.SYS`

#### Character Device Mapping

Character device mapping under CP/M 2.2 has 3 layers:

CP/M Logical Device --> CP/M Physical Device --> RomWBW HBIOS Device

The CP/M Logical Devices are:

| Device | Description                                                              |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CON:` | System console device, used by CCP for communication with the operator   |
| `RDR:` | Paper tape reader device                                                 |
| `PUN:` | Paper tape punch device                                                  |
| `LST:` | Output list device                                                       |

The CP/M Physical Devices are:

| Device | Description                                                              |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TTY:` | Teletype device (slow speed console)                                     |
| `CRT:` | Cathode ray tube device (high speed console)                             |
| `BAT:` | Batch processing (input from `RDR:`, output to `LST:`)                   |
| `UC1:` | User-defined console                                                     |
| `PTR:` | Paper tape reader (high speed reader)                                    |
| `UR1:` | User-defined reader #1                                                   |
| `UR2:` | User-defined reader #2                                                   |
| `PTP:` | Paper tape punch (high speed punch)                                      |
| `UP1:` | User-defined punch #1                                                    |
| `UP2:` | User-defined punch #2                                                    |
| `LPT:` | Line printer                                                             |
| `UL1:` | User-defined list device #1                                              |

CP/M Logical Devices are mapped to CP/M Physical Devices via the
IOBYTE at 0x0003 as shown below.

+----------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+
| Logical Device | `LST:`   | `PUN:`   | `RDR:`   | `CON:`   |
+----------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+
| IOBYTE Bits    | 7 6      | 5 4      | 3 2      | 1 0      |
+================+==========+==========+==========+==========+
| 0 (0b00)       | `TTY:`   | `TTY:`   | `TTY:`   | `TTY:`   |
+----------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+
| 1 (0b01)       | `CRT:`   | `PTP:`   | `PTR:`   | `CRT:`   |
+----------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+
| 2 (0b10)       | `LPT:`   | `UP1:`   | `UR1:`   | `BAT:`   |
+----------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+
| 3 (0b11)       | `UL1:`   | `UP2:`   | `UR2:`   | `UC1:`   |
+----------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+

The mappings above can be managed using the `STAT` command.  This
command essentially just modifies the IOBYTE value.

CP/M Physical Devices are mapped to RomWBW HBIOS devices during
the boot process depending on the number of HBIOS Char devices
in the system.

All CP/M Physical Devices are initially mapped to HBIOS Char 0.
If additional HBIOS Char devices are available in the system, they will
be mapped as below:

| CP/M   | RomWBW HBIOS     |
|--------|------------------|
| `TTY:` | Char 0           |
| `CRT:` | CRT              |
| `BAT:` | CP/M RDR/LST     |
| `UC1:` | Char 1           |
| `PTR:` | Char 1           |
| `UR1:` | Char 2           |
| `UR2:` | Char 3           |
| `PTP:` | Char 1           |
| `UP1:` | Char 2           |
| `UP2:` | Char 3           |
| `LPT:` | Char 1           |
| `UL1:` | Char 2           |

Normally, the HBIOS Console device (Loader prompt) is on HBIOS Device
Char 0.  If it has been reassigned to a different HBIOS character
device before launching CP/M, then the above mapping will be modified.
TTY: will be assigned to the current HBIOS console Char device.  The
remaining assignments will be filled in with the other Char devices
as available.

#### Notes

* You can change media, but it must be done while at the OS
  command prompt and you **must** warm start CP/M by pressing
  ctrl-C.  This is a CP/M 2.2 constraint and is well documented
  in the DRI manual.

* `SUBMIT.COM` has been patched per DRI to always place submit
  files on A:.  This ensures the submitted file will always be
  properly executed.

* The original versions of DDT, DDTZ, and ZSID used the RST 38
  vector which conflicts with interrupt mode 1 use of this vector.
  The DDT, DDTZ, and ZSID applications in RomWBW have been modified
  to use RST 30 to avoid this issue.

* Z-System applications will not run under CP/M 2.2.  For example,
  the `LDDS` date stamper will not work.

## Z-System

Z-System is the most popular non-DRI CP/M workalike "clone" which is generally
referred to as Z-System. Z-System is intended to be an enhanced
version of CP/M and should run all CP/M 2.2 applications. It is
optimized for the Z80 CPU (as opposed to 8080 for CP/M) and has some
significant improvements such as date/time stamping of files.

Z-System is a somewhat ambiguous term because there are multiple 
generations of this software.  RomWBW Z-System is a combination of both 
ZCPR-DJ (the CCP) and ZSDOS 1.1 (the BDOS) when referring to Z-System. 
The latest version of Z-System (ZCPR 3.4) is also provided with RomWBW 
via the NZ-COM adaptation (see below).

#### Documentation

* [ZCPR Manual]($doc_root$/CPM/ZCPR Manual.pdf)
* [ZCPR-DJ]($doc_root$/CPM/ZCPR-DJ.doc)
* [ZSDOS Manual]($doc_root$/CPM/ZSDOS Manual.pdf)

#### Boot Disk

To make a bootable Z-System disk, use the RomWBW `SYSCOPY` tool
to place a copy of the operating system on the boot track of
the disk.  The RomWBW ROM disk has a copy of the boot track
call "ZSYS.SYS".  For example:

`SYSCOPY C:=B:ZSYS.SYS`

#### Character Device Mapping

Mapping of character devices to RomWBW HBIOS Character devices
operates exactly the same as described in [Digital Research CP/M 2.2].
The CP/M 2.2 `STAT` command is used to manipulate the device mappings.

#### Notes

* Although most CP/M 2.2 applications will run under Z-System, some
  may not work as expected.  The best example is PIP which is not aware
  of the ZSDOS paths and will fail in some scenarios (use `COPY` instead).

* Although ZSDOS can recognize a media change in some cases, it will not
  always work.  You should only change media at a command prompt and be
  sure to warm start the OS with a ctrl-C.

* ZSDOS has a concept of fast relog of drives. This means that after a 
  warm start, it avoids the overhead of relogging all the disk drives. 
  There are times when this causes issues. After using tools like `CLRDIR` 
  or MAP, you may need to run “RELOG” to get the drive properly 
  recognized by ZSDOS.

* ZSVSTAMP expects to be running under the ZCPR 3.X command processor. 
  By default, RomWBW uses ZCPR 1.0 (intentionally, to reduce space usage) 
  and ZSVSTAMP will just abort in this case. It will work fine if you 
  implement NZCOM. ZSVSTAMP is included solely to facilitate usage 
  if/when you install NZCOM.

* Many of the tools can be configured (using either ZCNFG or DSCONFIG). 
  The configuration process modifies the actual application file itself. 
  This will fail if you try to modify one that is on the ROM disk because 
  it will not be able to update the image.

* DATSWEEP can be configured using DSCONFIG. However, DSCONFIG itself 
  needs to be configured first for proper terminal emulation by using 
  SETTERM. So, run SETTERM on DSCONFIG before using DSCONFIG to configure 
  DATSWEEP!

* Generic CP/M PIP and ZSDOS path searching do not mix well if you use 
  PIP to copy to or from a directory in the ZSDOS search path. Best to 
  use COPY from the ZSDOS distribution.

## NZCOM Automatic Z-System

NZCOM is a much further refined version of Z-System (ZCPR 3.4). NZCOM
was sold as an enhancement for existing users of CP/M 2.2 or ZSDOS.
For this reason, (by design) NZCOM does not provide a way to boot
directly from disk. Rather, it is loaded after the system boots into
a host OS. On the RomWBW NZCOM disk images, the boot OS is ZSDOS 1.1.
A `PROFILE.SUB` file is included which automatically launches NZCOM
as soon as ZSDOS loads.

NZCOM is a companion product to Z3PLUS, they are almost identical having
been written by the same team. The only difference is the base operating
system on which they run, but the architecture, the tools, libraries,
files, etc are all primarily the same.

NZCOM is highly configurable.  The RomWBW distribution has been
configured in the most basic way possible.  You should refer to the
documentation and use `MKZCM` as desired to customize your system.

NZCOM has substantially more functionality than CP/M or basic
Z-System.  It is important to read the "NZCOM Users
Manual.pdf" document in order to use this operating system effectively.

#### Documentation

* [NZCOM Users Manual]($doc_root$/CPM/NZCOM Users Manual.pdf)
* [Z-System Users Guide]($doc_root$/CPM/Z-System Users Guide.pdf)
* [ZCPR3.3 User Guide]($doc_root$/CPM/ZCPR3.3 User Guide.pdf)

#### Boot Disk

Since NZ-COM boots via Z-System, you can make a bootable
NZ-COM disk using `ZSYS.SYS` as described in [Z-System] above.  You
will need to add a `PROFILE.SUB` file to auto-start NZ-COM itself.

#### Character Device Mapping

Mapping of character devices to RomWBW HBIOS Character devices
operates exactly the same as described in [Digital Research CP/M 2.2].
However, it is **not** possible to manipulate the CP/M Logical to
Physical device mapping using the `STAT` command.  The mapping is
static.

Note: A custom ZCPR IOP module could theoretically be used to manage
the character device mappings.  RomWBW does not provide this module
and writing an IOP module is beyond the scope of this document.

#### Notes

* All of the notes for [Z-System] above generally apply to NZCOM.

* There is no `DIR` command, you must use `SDZ` instead.  If you don't
  like this, look into the `ALIAS` facility.

* For consistency with other ZCPR3 operating systems (ZPM3, Z3PLUS) 
  the SHOW.COM and HELP.COM command files were renamed to ZSHOW.COM
  and ZHELP.COM

## Digital Research CP/M 3

This is the Digital Research follow-up product to their very popular 
CP/M 2.2 operating system. While highly compatible with CP/M 2.2, it 
features many enhancements and is not 100% compatible. It makes direct 
use of banked memory to increase the user program space (TPA). It also 
has a new suite of support tools and help system.

* [CPM3 System Guide]($doc_root$/CPM/CPM3 System Guide.pdf)

#### Boot Disk

To create (or update) a CP/M 3 boot drive, you must place `CPMLDR.SYS` on
the system track of the disk.  You must also place `CPM3.SYS` and 
`CCP.COM` on the target drive as regular files.  Do **not** place 
CPM3.SYS on the boot track.  `CPMLDR.SYS` chain loads `CPM3.SYS` which 
must exist as a regular file on the disk.  Subsequently, `CPM3.SYS` 
loads `CCP.COM`.

The CP/M 3 boot files are not included on the ROM disk due to
space constraints.  You will need to transfer the following files to
your system from the RomWBW distribution directory Binary/CPM3.  You
can use XModem for this (or any of the mechanisms in [Transferring
Files].

- `CPMLDR.SYS`
- `CPM3.SYS` or `CPM3BNK.SYS`
- `CCP.COM`

The `CPM3.SYS` boot file is provided in 2 versions.  In the Binary/CPM3 
distribution directory, `CPM3.SYS` is the "non-banked" version of
CP/M 3.  The `CPM3BNK.SYS` file is the "banked" version of CP/M 3.  You 
almost certainly want to transfer the banked `CPM3BNK.SYS` version.

After transferring the boot files to your RomWBW system, you will
need to use `SYSCOPY` to place `CPMLDR.SYS` on the boot track of the
target drive.  `CPM3.SYS` and `CCP.COM` can be copied to the target
drive using any standard file copy tool such as `PIP` or `COPY`.

You do not need to be booted into CP/M 3 to create or update a CP/M 3 
disk.  The recommended approach is to boot CP/M 2.2 or Z-System from 
ROM.  Transfer the boot files to the RAM disk.  Then simply copy the 
files onto the CP/M 3 disk.  Assuming the target CP/M 3 disk is F:, you 
can use the following commands to place the files on the target drive:

```
SYSCOPY F:=A:CPMLDR.SYS
COPY A:CPM3BNK.SYS F:CPM3.SYS
COPY A:CCP.COM F:
```

Note in the example above that `CPM3BNK.SYS` is renamed to `CPM3.SYS`
in the copy command.

#### Character Device Mapping

Character device mapping under CP/M 3 has 3 layers:

CP/M Logical Device --> CP/M Physical Device --> RomWBW HBIOS Device

The primary CP/M Logical Devices are:

| Device | Description                                                              |
|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `CON:` | Console input or output device                                           |
| `AUX:` | Auxiliary Input or Output Device                                         |
| `LST:` | List output device, usually the printer                                  |

There are various aliases for these devices.  Please refer to the CP/M 3
Users Guide for more information.

The mapping of CP/M 3 Logical Devices to Physical Devices is performed
using the `DEVICE` command.

CP/M 3 refers to Physical Character Devices using the `COM` device 
label.  These `COM` devices are mapped directly to the RomWBW HBIOS Char
devices as described below:

|       `COM0:` --> HBIOS Char 0
|       `COM1:` --> HBIOS Char 1
|       `COM2:` --> HBIOS Char 2
|       . . .
|       `COMn:` --> HBIOS Char n

#### Notes

- The `COPYSYS` command described in the DRI CP/M 3 documentation is
  not provided with RomWBW.  The RomWBW `SYSCOPY` command is used
  instead.

- Although CP/M 3 is generally able to run CP/M 2.2 programs, this is
  not universally true.  This is especially true of the utility programs
  included with the operating system.  For example, the `SUBMIT`
  program   of CP/M 3 is completely different/incompatible from the
  `SUBMIT` program of CP/M 2.2.

- RomWBW fully supports CP/M 3 file date/time stamping, but this 
  requires that the disk be properly initialized for it.  This process 
  has not been performed on the CP/M 3 disk image.  Follow the 
  CP/M 3 documentation to complete this process, if desired.

## Z3PLUS Z-System for CP/M-Plus

Z3PLUS is a much further refined version of Z-System (ZCPR 3.4). Z3PLUS
was sold as an enhancement for existing users of CP/M 3.
For this reason, (by design) Z3PLUS does not provide a way to boot
directly from disk. Rather, it is loaded after the system boots into
CP/M 3. A `PROFILE.SUB` file is included which automatically launches 
Z3PLUS as soon as CP/M 3 loads.

Z3PLUS is a companion product to NZ-COM, they are almost identical having
been written by the same team. The only difference is the base operating 
system on which they run, but the architecture, the tools, libraries,
files, etc are all primarily the same.

Z3PLUS is highly configurable.  The RomWBW distribution has been
configured in the most basic way possible.  You should refer to the
documentation to customize your system.

Z3PLUS has substantially more functionality than CP/M 3 or the basic
Z-System.  It is important to read the "Z3PLUS Users Manual.pdf" 
document in order to use this operating system effectively.

#### Documentation

* [Z3PLUS Users Manual]($doc_root$/CPM/Z3PLUS Users Manual.pdf)
* [Z-System Users Guide]($doc_root$/CPM/Z-System Users Guide.pdf)
* [ZCPR3.3 User Guide]($doc_root$/CPM/ZCPR3.3 User Guide.pdf)

#### Boot Disk

Since Z3PLUS boots via CP/M 3, you first must make the disk CP/M 3
bootable. This is not a simple process, as well as placing `CPMLDR.SYS` on
the system track of the disk there are several files that are required 
on the disk itself.This is described in [Digital Research CP/M 3]
section above.

You will need to add a `PROFILE.SUB` file to auto-start Z3PLUS itself.

#### Character Device Mapping

Mapping of character devices to RomWBW HBIOS Character devices
operates exactly the same as described in [Digital Research CP/M 3].
The CP/M 3 `DEVICE` command is used to manipulate the device mappings.

#### Notes

* All of the notes for [Digital Research CP/M 3] above generally 
  apply to Z3PLUS.

* Some applications in the Z3PLUS distribution have been upgraded 
  with newer versions. This is done with in 

## ZPM3

Simeon Cran's ZPM3 is an interesting combination of the features of both
CP/M 3 and ZCPR3. Essentially, it has the features of and 
compatibility with both.

Due to this dual compatibility, the ZPM3 distribution image contains 
most of the standard CP/M 3 files as well as a variety of common ZCPR3 
applications.  However, you will notice that user area 0 of the disk has
only a few files.  Most of the files are distributed among other user 
areas which is standard practice for ZCPR3.  Most importantly, you will 
see most of the applications in user area 15.  The applications can be 
executed from any user area because ZPM3 has a default search path that 
includes User 15.

The ZPM3 distribution comes with essentially no utility programs at
all.  In addition to the standard CP/M 3 utilities, RomWBW includes
a variety of common ZCPR3 utilities.

#### Documentation

ZPM3 has no real documentation.  You are expected to understand both
CP/M 3 and ZCPR 3. The best source of information is:

* [CPM3 Users Guide]($doc_root$/CPM/CPM3 Users Guide.pdf)
* [CPM3 Command Summary]($doc_root$/CPM/CPM3 Command Summary.pdf)
* [CPM3 Programmers Guide]($doc_root$/CPM/CPM3 Programmers Guide.pdf)
* [CPM3 System Guide]($doc_root$/CPM/CPM3 System Guide.pdf)
* [Z-System Users Guide]($doc_root$/CPM/Z-System Users Guide.pdf)
* [ZCPR3.3 User Guide]($doc_root$/CPM/ZCPR3.3 User Guide.pdf)

#### Boot Disk

To create (or update) a ZPM3 boot drive, you must place `ZPMLDR.SYS` on 
the system track of the disk.  You must also place `CPM3.SYS`, 
`ZCCP.COM`, `ZINSTAL.ZPM`, and `STARTZPM.COM` on the target drive as 
regular files.  Do **not** place CPM3.SYS on the boot track. 
`ZPMLDR.SYS` chain loads `CPM3.SYS` which must exist as a regular file 
on the disk.  Subsequently, `CPM3.SYS` loads `CCP.COM`.

The CP/M 3 boot files are not included on the ROM disk due to space 
constraints.  You will need to transfer the following files to your 
system from the RomWBW distribution directory Binary/ZPM3.  You can use 
XModem for this (or any of the mechanisms in [Transferring Files].

- `ZPMLDR.SYS`
- `CPM3.SYS`
- `ZCCP.COM`
- `ZINSTAL.ZPM`
- `STARTZPM.COM`

You may be surprised to see the file called `CPM3.SYS`.  This is not a 
typo. Although it is called `CPM3.SYS`, it is ZPM and not the same as 
`CPM3.SYS` in the CPM3 directory.  Also, unlike CP/M 3, ZPM3 is always 
banked, so you will not find two versions of the file.  `CPM3.SYS` is a 
banked implementation of ZPM3.

After transferring the boot files to your RomWBW system, you will
need to use `SYSCOPY` to place `ZPMLDR.SYS` on the boot track of the
target drive.  The remaining boot files can be copied to the target
drive using any standard file copy tool such as `PIP` or `COPY`.

You do not need to be booted into ZPM3 to create or update a ZPM3 
disk.  The recommended approach is to boot CP/M 2.2 or Z-System from 
ROM.  Transfer the boot files to the RAM disk.  Then simply copy the 
files onto the ZPM disk.  Assuming the target ZPM3 disk is F:, you 
can use the following commands to place the files on the target drive:

```
SYSCOPY F:=A:ZPMLDR.SYS
COPY A:CPM3.SYS F:CPM3.SYS
COPY A:CCP.COM F:
COPY A:ZINSTAL.ZPM F:
COPY A:STARTZPM.COM F:
```

#### Character Device Mapping

Mapping of character devices to RomWBW HBIOS Character devices
operates exactly the same as described in [Digital Research CP/M 3].
The CP/M 3 `DEVICE` command is used to manipulate the device mappings.

#### Notes

- The ZPM3 operating system is contained in the file called CPM3.SYS 
  which is confusing, but this is as intended by the ZPM3 distribution.
  I believe it was done this way to make it easier for users to
  transition from CP/M 3 to ZPM3.

- The command line editing key bindings were slightly modified by
  Jon Saxton when he applied a few ZPM3 fixes.  This is explained
  in the file zpm3fix.txt in the distribution folder Source/ZPM3.
  The current key bindings are from the "New" column below.

| **Old** | **New** | **Function**                              |
|---------|---------|-------------------------------------------|
| ^A	  | ^A	    | one word left                             |
| ^B	  | ^B	    | to beginning/end of line                  |
| ^C	  | ^C	    | reboot if at start of line                |
| ^D	  | ^D	    | right one char                            |

## QP/M

QP/M is another OS providing compatibility with and enhancements
to CP/M 2.2.  It is provided as a bootable disk image for RomWBW.

Refer to the ReadMe.txt file in Source/Images/d_qpm for more details
regarding the RomWBW adaptation and customizations.

#### Documentation

* [QP/M 2.7 Installation Guide and Supplements]($doc_root$/CPM/qpm27.pdf)
* [QP/M 2.7 Interface Guide]($doc_root$/CPM/qdos27.pdf)
* [QP/M 2.7 Features and Facilities]($doc_root$/CPM/qcp27.pdf)

#### Boot Disk

To create or update a bootable QP/M Z-System disk, a special process
is required.  QP/M is not provided in source format.  You are expected
to install QP/M over an existing CP/M installation using the
`QINSTALL.COM` application.

To update an existing QP/M boot disk with the latest RomWBW CBIOS, you
must use 2 steps: apply the generic CP/M system track, then reinstall
the QP/M components.  To do this, you can perform the following steps:

1. Boot to the existing QP/M disk.  At this point, drive A should be
   the QP/M disk that you wish to update.  You may receive a warning
   about CBIOS/HBIOS version mismatch.

1. Use RomWBW `SYSCOPY` to place the stock RomWBW CP/M OS image
   onto the system tracks of the QP/M boot disk:

   `SYSCOPY A:=x:CPM.SYS`

   where x is the drive letter of your ROM Disk.

1. Run `QINSTALL` to overlay the QP/M OS components on your
   QP/M boot disk.

**WARNING**: `QINSTALL` has no mechanism for retaining previous
non-default settings.  Any previous non-default settings you
previously made with `QINSTALL` will need to be reapplied.  The
pre-built RomWBW QP/M disk image includes a couple of specific
non-default settings to optimize use with RomWBW.  Please review the
notes in the ReadMe.txt file in Source/Images/d_qpm.

#### Character Device Mapping

Mapping of character devices to RomWBW HBIOS Character devices operates 
exactly the same as described in [Digital Research CP/M 2.2]. The 
mappings can be viewed or modified using the QP/M `QSTAT` command which 
is analogous to the CP/M 2.2 `STAT` command.  Do **not** use the CP/M 
2.2 `STAT` command under QP/M.

#### Notes

- QPM is not available as source.  This implementation was based
  on the QPM binary distribution and has been minimally customized
  for RomWBW.

- When booted, the QPM startup banner will indicate CP/M 2.2.  This
  is because QPM uses the CP/M 2.2 CBIOS code.

- QINSTALL is used to customize QPM.  It is included on the
  disk image.  You should review the notes in the ReadMe.txt
  file in Source/Images/d_qpm before making changes.

- In addition to the QPM disk image, all of the QPM distribution
  files can be found in the RomWBW distribution in the
  Source/Images/d_qpm/u0 directory.

- The QPM disk image is not included as one of the slices on the
  RomWBW Combo Disk Image.  If you want to include QPM, you can do
  so by following the directions in Source/Images/Readme.txt.

## UCSD p-System

This is a full implementation of the UCSD p-System IV.0 for Z80
running under RomWBW.  Unlike the OSes above, p-System uses its
own unique filesystem and is not interoperable with other OSes.

It was derived from the p-System Adaptable Z80 System.  Unlike
some other distributions, this implements a native p-System
Z80 Extended BIOS, it does not rely on a CP/M BIOS layer.

The p-System is provided on a hard disk image file called
psys.img.  This must be copied to its own dedicated hard
disk media (CF Card, SD Card, etc.).  It is booted by
selecting slice 0 of the corresponding hard disk unit at
the RomWBW Boot Loader prompt.  Do not attempt to use
CP/M slices on the same disk.

Due to limitations in the p-System configuration mechanism, it does
not recognize the arrow keys of an ANSI Terminal.  To work around
this, the following control keys have been defined:

| Function   | Key        |
|------------|------------|
| Up         | ctrl+E     |
| Down       | ctrl+X     |
| Left       | ctrl+S     |
| Right      | ctrl+D     |

Refer to [Source/pSys/ReadMe.txt]($file_root$/Source/pSys/ReadMe.txt)
for more details about the p-System adaptation.

#### Documentation

* [UCSD p-System Users Manual]($doc_root$/UCSD p-System Users Manual.pdf)

#### Boot Disk

There is no mechanism provided to create a p-System boot disk from
scratch under RomWBW.  This has already been done as part of the
porting process.  You must use the provided p-System hard disk image
file which is bootable.

#### Character Device Mapping

RomWBW Character Devices are automatically assigned to p-System devices 
at startup.  The current HBIOS Console device is assigned to CONSOLE:.  
The next available HBIOS Char device is assigned to REMIN:/REMOUT:.  The
next available HBIOS Char devices is assigned to PRINTER:

#### Notes

* There is no floppy support at this time.

* The hard disk image contains 6 p-System slices which are
  assigned to p-System unit numbers 4, 5, 9, 10, 11, and 12 which
  is standard for p-System.  Slices 0-5 are assigned
  sequentially to these p-System unit numbers and it is
  not possible to reassign them.  Unit #4 (slice 0) is
  bootable and contains all of the p-System distribution
  files.  Unit #5 (slice 1) is just a blank p-System filesystem.
  The other units (9-12) have not been initialized, but this
  can be done from Filer using the Zero command.

* p-System relies heavily on the use of a full screen
  terminal.  This implementation has been setup to expect
  an ANSI or DEC VT-100 terminal or emulator.  The screen
  output will be garbled if no such terminal or emulator
  is used for console output.

* There is no built-in mechanism to move files in
  and out of p-System.  However, the .vol files in Source/pSys
  can be read and modified by CiderPress.  CiderPress is able
  to add and remove individual files.

  Andrew Davidson has created a Python script that can extract p-System 
  volumes from an existing disk image file.  The script is also capable
  of inserting a modified volume back into the disk image file.
  This tool is available at
  <https://github.com/robosnacks/psysimg>.

## FreeRTOS

Phillip Stevens has ported FreeRTOS to run under RomWBW. FreeRTOS is
not provided in the RomWBW distribution. FreeRTOS is available under
the [MIT licence](https://www.freertos.org/a00114.html)
and further general information is available at
[FreeRTOS](https://www.freertos.org/RTOS.html).

Phillip may be contacted via his
[GitHub Page](https://github.com/feilipu).

## Fuzix

Fuzix is a Unix-ish operating system for small systems.  It is the work 
of Alan Cox and is hosted on GitHub at
<https://github.com/EtchedPixels/FUZIX>. Fuzix itself is a stand-alone 
operating system, but it frequently utilizes RomWBW to boot and launch 
on RomWBW-supported platforms.

For those Fuzix platforms that leverage RomWBW for startup, you will
program your ROM with the normal RomWBW ROM -- there
is no Fuzix-specific ROM.  A Fuzix disk image for your system is then
written to your disk media.  After booting your system via the normal
RomWBW ROM, you start Fuzix simply by choosing the disk device
containing the Fuzix image at the RomWBW Loader prompt.

To create a Fuzix disk image:

* Locate and download the Fuzix disk image for your system from
  <https://www.fuzix.org/>.  For each platform, you will typically
  find two image files.  An emulator image (`emu-xxx.img`) and a
  disk image (`disk.img`).  You want the disk image file.

* Write the disk image file to your physical media (CF Card, SD Card,
  etc.) starting at the beginning of the media (first sector).  Do
  not combine the Fuzix image with the RomWBW disk images -- they are
  entirely separate.

To boot into Fuzix:

* Insert your Fuzix disk media.

* Power-up or reset your system.  RomWBW should load normally
  and bring you to the RomWBW Boot Loader prompt.

* Depending on the platform, Fuzix may be built to run at a different
  baud rate that the default RomWBW baud rate.  If so, it is best to
  change your RomWBW baud rate prior to initiating the Fuzix startup.
  You can do this at the loader prompt with a command like this:

  `I 0 38400`

  Replace 38400 with the desired baud rate for Fuzix.  You will be
  prompted to change your terminal's baud rate at this time.

* At the RomWBW Boot Loader prompt, enter the disk unit number of
  the Fuzix media.  Fuzix should load and you will see device
  discovery/information messages that vary depending on your
  platform.  This is a typical example:

  ```
  RCBus [RCZ180_nat_wbw] Boot Loader
  FP Switches = 0x00

  Boot [H=Help]: 2

  Booting Disk Unit 2, Slice 0, Sector 0x00000000...

  FUZIX version 0.4

  ```

* At the `login:` prompt, enter `root`.  No password is required.  You
  should then get a Fuzix `#` command prompt.

  ```
  login: root

  Welcome to FUZIX.
  #
  ```

You may now use Fuzix as desired.  The general operation and use of
Fuzix is outside of the scope of this document.

# Custom Applications

The operation of the RomWBW hosted operating systems is enhanced through
several custom applications. You have already read about one of these --
the `ASSIGN` command.  These applications are functional on all of the
OS variants included with RomWBW.

The applications discussed here are **not** the same as the built-in
ROM applications mentioned previously.  These applications run as
commands within the operating systems provided by RomWBW.  So, these
commands are only available at an operating system prompt after an
operating system has been loaded.

All of the RomWBW Custom Applications are built to function under all
of the RomWBW Operating Systems (except for p-System).  In general,
the applications will automatically adapt as needed to the currently
running operating system.  One exception is `FDU` -- the Floppy Disk
Utility.  This application requires that you pick the floppy disk
interface you want to interact with.

There is more complete documentation of all of these applications in
the related RomWBW manual "$doc_apps$" found in the Doc
directory of the distribution.

The following custom applications are found on the ROM disk and are,
therefore, globally available.

| **Application** | **Description                                                                                        |

Some custom applications do not fit on the ROM disk. They are found on the
disk image files or the individual files can be found in the Binary/Apps
directory of the distribution.  They are also included on the
floppy disk and hard disk images.

# Real Time Clock

RomWBW supports a variety of real time clock hardware.  If your
system has this hardware, then it will be able to maintain the
current date and time even while your system is turned off.

Additionally, depending on the operating system being used, you may be
able to utilize date/time stamping of files.
To facilitate this a CP/M clock driver (WBWCLK) has been included 
inside `CLOCKS.DAT` that will read the clock via a RomWBW HBIOS call

You can determine if your system has a real time clock present (and
functioning) by looking at the boot messages.  Here is an example of
a boot message reflecting the detection of a valid real time clock
module:

`DSRTC: MODE=STD IO=0x8A Thu 2023-10-19 14:07:11 CHARGE=ON`

This example is from a DSRTC clock module.  You may have a different
one, but it will always display the current date/time.

In some cases, your real time clock will support charging of the
battery or super-capacitor while the system has power.  The status of
this charging is displayed.

If the date/time of your RTC needs to be updated, you will need to do
this with one of the utilities described below.  There is no ability to
update the date/time of the RTC in the RomWBW Boot Loader or Monitor.

## Date/Time Utilities

RomwWBW includes two utilities for displaying or setting the date/time
stored by the RTC.  They are both a bit different and are briefly
described below.

A third utility `TESTCLOK` is also included as part of ZSDOS

### WDATE Utility

The `WDATE` utility (contributed by Kevin Boone) is an application
that will display and/or update the current date/time.  Its operation is
described in $doc_apps$.  This utility works with any of the supported
RomWBW RTC hardware.  Here is an example of displaying and updating the
date/time with this utility:

```
A>wdate
Thursday 19 October 14:14:43 2023

A>wdate 23 10 19 14 24 30

A>wdate
Thursday 19 October 14:24:34 2023

```

Note that `WDATE` does not have anything to do with date/time stamping
of files.  It merely displays and sets the real time clock value.

### RTC Utility

Like `WDATE`, the `RTC` utility (contributed by Andrew Lynch) will let
you display and set the current date/time.  However, this utility only
works with the DSRTC hardware (DS1302 chip).  It is a "direct to
hardware application".  Its operation is described in $doc_apps$.  Here
is an example of displaying and updatting the date/time with this
utility:

```
A>rtc
Start RTC Program
RomWBW HBIOS, Mark 4 RTC Latch Port 0x8A

RTC: Version 1.9
Commands: E)xit T)ime st(A)rt S)et R)aw L)oop C)harge N)ocharge D)elay I)nit G)et P)ut B)oot W)arm-start H)elp

RTC>t
Current time: 23-10-19 14:30:25-05

RTC>i
Init date/time.

YEAR:23
MONTH:10
DATE:19
HOURS:14
MINUTES:31
SECONDS:00
DAY:05
```

The `RTC` utility is also capable of turning the charging feature of
the DS1320 chip on or off.  Here is an example of turning if off and
back on:

```

A>rtc
Start RTC Program
RomWBW HBIOS, Mark 4 RTC Latch Port 0x8A


RTC: Version 1.9
Commands: E)xit T)ime st(A)rt S)et R)aw L)oop C)harge N)ocharge D)elay I)nit G)et P)ut B)oot W)arm-start H)elp

RTC>n
Trickle charger disabled.

RTC>c
Trickle charger enabled.
```

Do **not** enable charging unless you are sure that your system
supports this.  If your RTC is being powered by a normal battery, it
would be dangerous to enable charging.

### TESTCLOK Utility

The `TESTCLOK` utility is used to test a selected CPM clock driver 
loaded from the CLOCKS.DAT file. After selecting the location of CLOCKS.DAT 
and the clock driver (45. WBWCLK) it displays the currently configured time 
until a key is pressed.

Since this runs at the CPM driver level it is useful as an end-to-end test
to prove that date time stamping is able to read the correct time

The `TESTCLOK` utility is provided by ZSDOS, plese see the ZSDOS Manual 
for further information

## Date/Time File Stamping

If an RTC is available in your system, then most operating systems
can use it to date/time stamp files.  This just means recording the
date/time of file creation, update, and or access in the directory.
This capability is available in all of the RomWBW operating system
except the original DRI CP/M 2.2.

Three types of date/time stamping are supported using realtime clock 
supported by RomWBW HBIOS. DateStamper, NZT and P2DOS.

In some cases (such as ZSDOS), you must load an RSX (memory resident 
utility) to enable date/time stamping of files. This could be automated 
using a `PROFILE.SUB` file.
Preconfigured loaders are provided, bypassing the need to use SETUPZST.

Additionally, you will need to initialize the directory. The procedure varies
depending on the date/time stamping mechanism, so you must review the associated documentation.

The date/time stamping mechanisms for each operating system are
generally not compatible.  If you initialize a directory for a type
of stamping, you should be careful not to manipulate that directory
with a different operating system with a different date/time stamping
mechanism.  Doing so may corrupt the directory.

The RomWBW disk images do not have date/time stamping initialized.  This
is to avoid any chance of directory corruption.

### DateStamper

DateStamper datestamping follows the standard set by Plu*Perfect Systems. 
This method stores stamps in a disk file named `!!!TIME&.DAT`. 
Only DateStamper stamping stores full time and date stamps for
file Creation, Last Modification, and Last Access, 
and may be used with any CP/M diskette format. In addition, 
the DateStamper protocol is supported by a mature set of compatible utilities.

Key Utilities

* LDDS.COM - Load DateStamper date/time stamping resident extension. (RomWBW Provided)
* PUTDS.COM - Prepare disk for DateStamper date/time stamping.

After using PUTDS to initialize a directory for ZDS date stamping,
it may be necessary to run RELOG before the stamping routines 
will actually start working.

### P2DOS (CP/M Plus compatible)

CP/M Plus-type datestamping is also widely used due to the popularity 
of CP/M Plus (also know as CP/M 3). CP/M Plus-type file datestamping uses 
directory sectors to store file datestamps which may be accessed more quickly 
by programs, but there is no Last File Access stamp. Finally, the range of 
utilities for this type of stamps is more limited than for the DateStamper protocol.

Key Utilities

* LDP2D.COM - Load P2DOS date/time stamping resident extension. (RomWBW Provided)
* INITDIR.COM - Prepares disks for P2DOS-type file stamping.

### NZT

_The use of NZT needs to be further documented_

Key Utilities

* LDNZT.COM - Load NZT date/time stamping resident extension. (RomWBW Provided)

### Additional Notes

The following files have been provided, customised and tested for for use in RomWBW

* `CLOCKS.DAT` - Library of clock drivers, which has been updated to include 
   the RomWBW clock driver WBWCLK, and also includes the SIMHCLOK clock driver.
   The file is just a standard LU type library and is easily updated using NULU. 
   The members are the relocatable binaries, but with the .REL extension removed.
* `STAMPS.DAT` - Library of available date/time stamping modules for SETUPZST.
   The file has been replaced with an updated version from the Walnut Creek CP/M CDROM. 
   The original version has a bug that prevents RSX (resident system extension) mode 
   to load properly.

Additional Notes

* `SETUPZST` (provided by ZSDOS) Should not normally be needed since the 
   creation of the appropriate LDTIM loaders has already been performed.
* `FILEDATE` only works with DateStamper style date stamping. If you run
   it on a drive that is not initialized for DateStamper, it will complain
   `FILEDATE, !!!TIME&.DAT missing`. This is normal and just means that
   you have not initialized that drive for DateStamper (using PUTDS).
* `ZXD` will handle either DateStamper or P2DOS type date stamping.
   However, it **must** be configured appropriately. As distributed, it will
   look for P2DOS date stamps. Use ZCNFG to reconfigure it for P2DOS if
   that is what you are using.

## Timezone

None of the operating systems distributed with RomWBW have any concept
of timezone.  When files are date/time stamped, the date/time will
simply be whatever date/time the RTC currently has.

The normal practice is to set the RTC to your local time.  This implies
that you would need to manually adjust the RTC for daylight savings time
and/or when you travel to a different time zone.

The date/time stamps of files in directories will also be stored in
local time.  This includes files stored in a FAT filesystem.  If you
subsequently view the directory from modern machines (Windows, Linux,
etc.), the date/time displayed will depend on the behavior of the
modern system.

For example, Linux assumes that the date/time of files
is UTC.  So, if you create a file on a FAT filesystem with your RomWBW
computer and then use Linux to view the directory, the date/time stamps
will seem "off" by a few hours.

The only alternative you may consider is setting the date/time of your
RTC to UTC.  Since UTC is consistent across all timezones and daylight
savings time, your file date/time stamps will also be consistent.  Of
course, this will mean that your RomWBW computer will display a
date/time that seems wrong because it is not local time.

# CP/NET Networking

Digital Research created a simple network file sharing system called 
CP/NET.  This allowed a network server running CP/NOS to host files 
available to network attached CP/M computers.  Essentially, the host
becomes a simple file sharing server.

RomWBW disk images include an adaptation of the DRI CP/NET client 
software provided by Douglas Miller.  RomWBW does not support operation 
as a network server itself.  However, Douglas has also developed a 
Java-based implementation of the DRI network server that can be used to 
provide host services from a modern computer.

Both CP/NET 1.2 and 3.0 clients are provided.  Version 1.2 is for use 
with CP/M 2.2 and compatible OSes.  Version 3.0 is for use with CP/M 3 
and compatible OSes.

The CP/NET client software provided with RomWBW requires a supported
ethernet interface module.  At this time, the following are supported:

* RCBus MT011 w/ Ethernet Featherwing and (optionally) SPI FRAM
  (e.g., Adafruit SPI Non-Volatile FRAM Breakout)
* Duodyne Disk I/O w/ Wiz850IO and (optionally) SPI NVRAM
  (e.g., 25LC256)
* Generic Serial Interface

**NOTE:** The Generic Serial Interface is supported by RomWBW, but is
not documented here.  You must refer to the CP/NET documentation
referenced below.

The client software interacts directly with this hardware.  In a future 
version of RomWBW, I hope to add a generic networking API that will 
allow a greater range of network hardware to be used.

To use CP/NET effectively, you will want to review the documentation 
provided by Douglas on at his
[cpnet-z80 GitHub Project](https://github.com/durgadas311/cpnet-z80). 
Additionally, you should consult the DRI documentation which is not 
included with RomWBW, but is available on the
[cpnet-z80](https://github.com/durgadas311/cpnet-z80) site.

Below, I will provide the general steps involved in setting up a
network using MT011 with RomWBW.

## CP/NET Client Setup

The CP/NET client files are included on the RomWBW disk images, but
they are found in user area 4.  They are placed there to avoid
confusing anyone that is not specifically trying to run a network
client.  They are only found on the CPM 2.2 and CP/M 3 slices.  Using
CP/NET on alternative OSes may work, but is not officially supported.

The CP/NET client files are packaged in `.LBR` library files.  The
library files are found in user area 4.

| File         | CP/NET Version | OS       | Hardware              |
|--------------|----------------|----------|-----------------------|
| CPN12MT.LBR  | CP/NET 1.2     | CP/M 2.2 | RCBus w/ MT011        |
| CPN3MT.LBR   | CP/NET 3       | CP/M 3   | RCBus w/ MT011        |
| CPN12DUO.LBR | CP/NET 1.2     | CP/M 2.2 | Duodyne w/ Disk I/O   |
| CPN3DUO.LBR  | CP/NET 3       | CP/M 3   | Duodyne w/ Disk I/O   |
| CPN12SER.LBR | CP/NET 1.2     | CP/M 2.2 | RomWBW Serial Port    |
| CPN3SER.LBR  | CP/NET 3       | CP/M 3   | RomWBW Serial Port    |

First, you need to merge the files from the correct library file
into user area 0.  This is done by extracting the files using the
`NULU` library management utility application.

1. Start NULU specifying desired CP/NET library for \<filename\>:

   `A>NULU 4:<filename>`

2. At the NULU prompt, extract the files using the `-E *.*` command:

   `-READY A0:>-E *.*`

3. Exit NULU using the `-X` command:

   `-Extract members A0:>-x`

Here is an example of extracting the CP/NET 1.2 client files for an 
RCBus system w/ MT011.  You should be in user area 0 when performing 
this operation.

```

```



At this point, you will need to configure your ethernet adapter for your
 local network using `WIZCFG`.  The definitive guide to the use of 
`WIZCFG` is on the [cpnet-z80](https://github.com/durgadas311/cpnet-z80)
site in the document called "CPNET-WIZ850io.pdf". Here is an example of
the commands needed to configure the WizNet:

|                                    |                                        |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `wizcfg w n F0`                    | set CP/NET node id                     |
| `wizcfg w i 192.168.1.201`         | set WizNet IP address                  |
| `wizcfg w g 192.168.1.1`           | set local network gateway IP address   |
| `wizcfg w s 255.255.255.0`         | set WizNet subnet mask                 |
| `wizcfg w 0 00 192.168.1.3 31100`  | set server node ID, IP address, & port |

You will need to use values appropriate for your local network.  You can
use the command `wiznet w` to display the current values which is 
useful to confirm they have been set as intended.

```
A>wizcfg w
Node ID:  F0H
IP Addr:  192.168.1.201
Gateway:  192.168.1.1
Subnet:   255.255.255.0
MAC:      98:76:B6:11:00:C4
Socket 0: 00H 192.168.1.3 31100 0
```

These values can be persisted across power-cycles if your system has
NVRAM storage.  To program the values into your NVRAM, you would use
the same commands as above, but omit the `w` parameter.  The
"CPNET-WIZ850io.pdf" document is highly recommended to understand the
operation of `WIZCFG`.

If you do not utilize NVRAM to persist your configuration, you will need
to reapply these commands every time you power cycle your RomWBW 
computer, so I recommend putting them into a `SUBMIT` file.

After applying these commands, you should be able ping the WizNet from
another computer on the local network.  If this works, then the 
client-side is ready.

## CP/NET Sever Setup

These instructions will assume you are using Douglas Miller's 
CpnetSocketServer to implement a CP/NOS server on your network.  The 
definitive guide to this software is also on the [cpnet-z80] 
(https://github.com/durgadas311/cpnet-z80) site and is called 
"CpnetSocketServer.pdf".

The software is a Java application, so it can generally run anywhere
there is a Java runtime environment available.  I have normally used
it on a Linux system and have had good results with that.

You will need to download the application called "CpnetSocketServer.jar"
from the [cpnet-z80](https://github.com/durgadas311/cpnet-z80) site. The
application uses a configuration file.  My configuration file is called
"cpnet00.rc" and has these contents:

```
cpnetserver_host = 192.168.1.3
cpnetserver_port = 31100
cpnetserver_temp = P
cpnetserver_sid = 00
cpnetserver_max = 16
cpnetserver_root_dir = /home/wayne/cpnet/root
```

You will also need to setup a directory structure with the drive
letters per the documentation.

To start the server, you would use a command like this:

`java -jar CpnetSocketServer.jar conf=cpnet00.rc`

At this point, the server should start and you should see the following:

```
CpnetSocketServer v1.3
Using config in cpnet00.rc
Server 00 Listening on 192.168.1.3 port 31100 debug false
```

Your CP/NET server should now be ready to accept client connections.

## CP/NET Usage

With both the client and server configured, you are ready to load and
use CP/NET on your RomWBW system.  CP/NET documentation is available
on the [cpnet-z80](https://github.com/durgadas311/cpnet-z80) site.
The document is called "dri-cpnet.pdf".

Under CP/M 2.2, you will start the networking client using the command 
`CPNETLDR`.  Under CP/M 3, you use the command `NDOS3`. If that works, 
you can map network drives as local drives using the `NETWORK` command.
The `CPNETSTS` command is useful for displaying the current status.
Here is a sample session from CP/M 2.2:

```
A>cpnetldr

Disk device status:
  Drive A: = LOCAL
  Drive B: = LOCAL
  Drive C: = LOCAL
  Drive D: = LOCAL
  Drive E: = LOCAL
  Drive F: = LOCAL
  Drive G: = LOCAL
  Drive H: = LOCAL
  Drive I: = LOCAL
  Drive J: = LOCAL
  Drive K: = Drive C: on Network Server ID = 00H
  Drive L: = LOCAL
  Drive M: = LOCAL
  Drive N: = LOCAL
  Drive O: = LOCAL
  Drive P: = LOCAL
Console Device = LOCAL
List Device = LOCAL
```

If you are using CpSocketServer to provide the CP/NOS server, then
you will see some messages on your server console when clients
connect.  Here are the messages issued by the server in the above
example:

```
Connection from 192.168.1.201 (31100)
Remote 192.168.1.201 is f0
Creating HostFileBdos 00 device with root dir /home/wayne/cpnet/root
```

At this point CP/NET is ready for general use.  You should be able
to access files on the network mapped drives just like files on your
local drives.

## Network Boot

It is possible to boot your RomWBW system directly from a
network server if it has the required hardware.  This means that the operating system will be loaded 
directly from the network server and all of your drive letters will be 
provided by the network server.  The supported hardware is:

- RCBus System w/ MT011 including:
  - Featherwing WizNet W5500
  - SPI FRAM on secondary SPI interface (CS2)
- Doudyne Disk I/O Board including:
  - WIZ850io Module
  - 25LCxxx Serial SPI EEPROM
  
Unlike the CP/NET Client, the presence of dedicated non-volatile
storage is required to hold the network configuration.  This will be
FRAM (for MT011) or Serial SPI EEPROM (Duodyne).    The NVRAM is used to store your WizNet 
configuration values so they do not need to be re-entered every time you
power-cycle your system.

It is important to understand that the operating system that is loaded
in this case is **not** a RomWBW enhanced operating system.  Some
commands (such as the `ASSIGN` command) will not be possible.  Also,
you will only have access to drives provided by the network server --
no local disk drives will be available.

Using the same values from the previous example, you would
issue the `WIZCFG` commands:

```
wizcfg n F0
wizcfg i 192.168.1.201
wizcfg g 192.168.1.1
wizcfg s 255.255.255.0
wizcfg 0 00 192.168.1.3 31100
```

Note that the 'w' parameter is now omitted which causes these values to
be written to NVRAM.

As before, your network server will need to be running 
CpnetSocketServer. However, you will need to setup a directory that 
contains some files that will be sent to your RomWBW system when the 
Network boot is performed.  By default the directory will be
`~/NetBoot`.  In this directory you need to place the following files:

* `cpnos.sys`
* `ndos.spr`
* `snios.spr`

You also need to make sure CpnetSocketServer is configured with an 'A' 
drive and that drive must contain (at an absolute minimum) the following
file:

* `ccp.spr`

All of these files are found in the Binary/CPNET/NetBoot directory of 
the RomWBW distribution.  You will find 2 sub-directories named MT and
DUO.  Get the files from the sub-directory corresponding to your
specific hardware.

Finally, you need to add the following line to your CpnetSocketServer 
configuration file:

`netboot_default = cpnos.sys`

To perform the network boot, you start your RomWBW system normally which
should leave you at the Boot Loader prompt.  The 'N' command will
initiate the network boot.  Here is an example of what this looks like:

```
RCBus [RCZ180_nat_wbw] Boot Loader

Boot [H=Help]: n

Loading Network Boot...
MT011 WizNET Network Boot

WBWBIOS  SPR  FD00 0100
COBDOS   SPR  FA00 0300
SNIOS    SPR  F600 0400
NDOS     SPR  EA00 0C00

58K TPA

A>
```

The CP/M operating system and the CP/NET components have been loaded 
directly from the network server.  All of your drive letters are 
automatically mapped directly to the drive letters configured with 
CpnetSocketServer.

```
A>cpnetsts

CP/NET 1.2 Status
=================
Requester ID = F0H
Network Status Byte = 10H
Disk device status:
  Drive A: = Drive A: on Network Server ID = 00H
  Drive B: = Drive B: on Network Server ID = 00H
  Drive C: = Drive C: on Network Server ID = 00H
  Drive D: = Drive D: on Network Server ID = 00H
  Drive E: = Drive E: on Network Server ID = 00H
  Drive F: = Drive F: on Network Server ID = 00H
  Drive G: = Drive G: on Network Server ID = 00H
  Drive H: = Drive H: on Network Server ID = 00H
  Drive I: = Drive I: on Network Server ID = 00H
  Drive J: = Drive J: on Network Server ID = 00H
  Drive K: = Drive K: on Network Server ID = 00H
  Drive L: = Drive L: on Network Server ID = 00H
  Drive M: = Drive M: on Network Server ID = 00H
  Drive N: = Drive N: on Network Server ID = 00H
  Drive O: = Drive O: on Network Server ID = 00H
  Drive P: = Drive P: on Network Server ID = 00H
Console Device = LOCAL
List Device = LOCAL
```

At this point you can use CP/M and CP/NET normally, but all disk
access will be to/from the network drives.  There is no access to
your local disk drives in this boot mode.

# Transferring Files

Transferring files between your modern computer and your RomWBW
system can be achieved in a variety of ways. The most common of these
are described below. All of these have a certain degree of complexity
and I encourage new users to use the available community forums to
seek assistance as needed.

## Serial Port Transfers

RomWBW provides an serial file transfer program called XModem that
has been adapted to run under RomWBW hardware. The program is called
`XM` and is on your ROM disk as well as all of the pre-built disk
images.

You can type `XM` by itself to get usage information. In general, you
will run `XM` with parameters to indicate you want to send or receive
a file on your RomWBW system. Then, you will use your modern
computers terminal program to complete the process.

The `XM` application generally tries to detect the hardware you are
using and adapt to it. However, you must ensure that you have a
reliable serial connection. You must also ensure that the speed of
the connection is not too fast for XModem to service.  If your
file transfer attempts are failing, try either of the following:

- Check that hardware flow control is enabled in your terminal
  emulation software.
- Reduce the speed of your serial port connection.

There is an odd interaction between XModem and partner terminal
programs that can occur. Essentially, after launching `XM`, you must
start the protocol on your modern computer fairly quickly (usually in
about 20 seconds or so). So, if you do not pick a file on your modern
computer quickly enough, you will find that the transfer completes
about 16K, then hangs. The interaction that causes this is beyond the
scope of this document.

## Disk Image Transfers

It is possible to pass disk images between your RomWBW system and
your modern computer. This assumes you have an appropriate media slot
on your modern computer for the media you want to use (CF Card, SD
Card, floppy drive, etc.).

The general process to get files from your modern computer to a RomWBW
computer is:

1. Use `cpmtools` on your modern computer to create a RomWBW CP/M
filesystem image.

2. Insert your RomWBW media (CF Card, SD Card, floppy disk, etc.) in
your modern computer.

3. Use a disk imaging tool to copy the RomWBW filesystem image onto the
media.

4. Move the media back to the RomWBW computer.

This process is a little complicated, but it has the benefit of
allowing you to get a lot of files over to your RomWBW system quickly
and with little chance of corruption.

The process can be run in reverse to get files from your RomWBW
computer to a modern computer.

The exact use of these tools is a bit too much for this document, but
the tools are all included in the RomWBW distribution along with
usage documents.

Note that the build scripts for RomWBW create the default disk images
supplied with RomWBW. It is relatively easy to customize the contents
of the disk images that are part of RomWBW. This is described in more
detail in the Source/Images directory of the distribution.

## FAT Filesystem Transfers

The FAT filesystem format that originated with MS-DOS is almost
ubiquitous across modern computers.  Virtually all operating systems
now support reading and writing files to a FAT filesystem.  For this
reason, RomWBW now has the ability to read and write files on FAT
filesystems.

This capability means that you can generally use your modern computer 
to make an SD Card, CF Card, or USB Drive with a standard FAT filesystem 
on it, then place that media in your RomWBW computer and access the files.

* Files can be copied between a FAT filesystem and a CP/M filesystem,
  but you cannot execute files directly from a FAT filesystem.

* FAT12, FAT16, and FAT32 formats are supported.

* Long filenames are not supported.  Files with long filenames will
  show up with their names truncated into the older 8.3 convention.
  If you have files on your modern computer with long filenames, 
  it is usually easiest to rename them on the modern computer.

* A FAT filesystem can be located on floppy or hard disk media.  For
  hard disk media, a valid FAT Filesystem partition must exist.

Some additional **Notes** and **WARNINGS** Things to be careful about

* CP/M (and compatible) OSes do not support all of the
  filename characters that a modern computer does.  The following
  characters are **not permitted** in a CP/M filename:

  `< > . , ; : = ? * [ ] _ % | ( ) / \`

  The FAT application does not auto-rename files when it encounters
  invalid filenames.  It will just issue an error and quit.
  Additionally, the error message is not very clear about the problem.

* Microsoft Windows will sometimes suggest **reformatting**
  partitions that it does not recognize (e.g. RomWBW).
  If you are using media that contains both a FAT partition
  and a RomWBW partition you may prompted to format a partition of your 
  SD/CF/USB Media when inserting the card into a Windows computer, 
  you probably want to select Cancel.

### FAT Filesystem Preparation

In general, you can create media formatted with a FAT filesystem on
your RomWBW computer or on your modern computer.  We will only be
discussing the RomWBW-based approach here.

#### Floppy Disk

In the case of a floppy disk, you can use the `FAT` application to
format the floppy disk.  The floppy disk must already be physically
formatted using RomWBW FDU or equivalent.  If your floppy disk is on
RomWBW disk unit 2, you could use `FAT FORMAT 2:`.  This will overwrite
the floppy with a FAT filesystem and all previous contents will be lost.
Once formatted this way, the floppy disk can be used in a floppy drive
attached to a modern computer or it can be used on RomWBW using the
other `FAT` tool commands.

#### Hard Disk

In the case of hard disk media, it is necessary to have a FAT
partition.  If you prepared your RomWBW hard disk media using the
disk image process, then this partition will already be defined and
you do not need to recreate it.  This default FAT partition is located
at approximately 512MB from the start of your disk and it is 384MB in
size.  So, your hard disk media must be 1GB or greater to use this
default FAT partition.

You can confirm the existence of the FAT partition with `FDISK80` by
using the 'P' command to show the current partition table.  Here is an
example of a partition table listing from `FDISK80` that includes the
FAT partition (labelled "FAT16"):

```
Capacity of disk 4:  (  4G)  7813120      Geom 77381010
Nr  ---Type- A --      Start         End   LBA start  LBA count  Size
 1    RomWBW   2e      8:0:1  1023:15:16        2048    1048576  512M
 2     FAT16   06   1023:0:1  1023:15:16     1050624     786432  384M
 3             00       *** empty ***
 4             00       *** empty ***
```

If your hard disk media does not have a FAT partition already defined,
you will need to define one using FDISK80 by using the 'N' command.
Ensure that the location and size of the FAT partition does not
overlap any of the CP/M slice area and that it fits within the size
of your media.

Once the partition is defined, you will still need to format it.  Just
as with a floppy disk, you use the `FAT` tool to do this.  If your
hard disk media is on RomWBW disk unit 4, you would use `FAT FORMAT 4:`.
This will look something like this:

```
E>fat format 4:

About to format FAT Filesystem on Disk Unit #4.
All existing FAT partition data will be destroyed!!!

Continue (y/n)?

Formatting... Done
```

Your FAT filesystem is now ready to use.

If your RomWBW system has multiple disk drives/slots, you can also just
create a disk with your modern computer that is a dedicated FAT
filesystem disk.  You can use your modern computer to format the disk
(floppy, CF Card, SD Card, etc.), then insert the disk in your RomWBW
computer and access it using `FAT` based on its RomWBW unit number.

### FAT Application Usage

Transferring files is accomplished by running a RomWBW custom application 
called `FAT`. This application understands both FAT filesystems as well 
as CP/M filesystems.

To copy files from your modern computer to your RomWBW computer, start 
by putting the disk media with the FAT filesystem in your modern 
computer.  The modern computer should recognize it. Then copy the files 
you want to get to your RomWBW computer onto this media.  Once done, 
remove the media from your modern computer and insert it in the RomWBW 
computer.  

Finally, use the `FAT` tool to copy the files onto a CP/M 
drive. This process works just fine in reverse if you want to copy files from a
CP/M filesystem to your modern computer.

Complete instructions for the `FAT` application are found in $doc_apps$.
Here, we will just provide a couple of simple examples.  Note that the
FAT application is not on the ROM disk because it is too large to
include there.

The most important thing to understand about the `FAT` application is
how it refers to FAT filesystems vs. CP/M filesystems.  It infers this
based on the file specification provided.  If you use a specification
like `C:SAMPLE.TXT`, it will use the C: drive of your CP/M operating
system.  If you use a specification like `4:SAMPLE.TXT`, it will use
the FAT filesystem on the disk in RomWBW disk unit 4.  Basically, if
you start your file or directory specification with a number followed
by a colon, it means FAT filesystem.  Anything else will mean CP/M
filesystem.

Here are a few examples.  This first example shows how to get a FAT
directory listing from RomWBW disk unit 4:

```
E>fat dir 4:

Directory of 4:


E>
```

As you can see, there are currently no files there.  Now let's copy
a file from CP/M to the FAT directory:

```
E>fat copy sample.txt 4:

Copying...

SAMPLE.TXT ==> 4:/SAMPLE.TXT ... [OK]

    1 File(s) Copied
```

If we list the FAT directory again, you will see the file:

```
E>fat dir 4:

Directory of 4:

01/30/2023  17:50:14         29952  ---A  SAMPLE.TXT

```

Now let's copy the file from the FAT filesystem back to CP/M.  This
time we will get a warning about overwriting the file.  For this
example, we don't want to do that, so we abort and reissue the
command specifying a new filename to use:

```
E>fat copy 4:sample.txt e:

Copying...

4:/SAMPLE.TXT ==> E:SAMPLE.TXT Overwrite? (Y/N) [Skipped]

    0 File(s) Copied

E>fat copy 4:sample.txt e:sample2.txt

Copying...

4:/SAMPLE.TXT ==> E:SAMPLE2.TXT ... [OK]

    1 File(s) Copied
```

Finally, let's try using wildcards:

```
E>fat copy sample*.* 4:

Copying...

SAMPLE.TXT ==> 4:/SAMPLE.TXT Overwrite? (Y/N) ... [OK]
SAMPLE2.TXT ==> 4:/SAMPLE2.TXT ... [OK]

    2 File(s) Copied
```

# Customizing RomWBW

## Startup Command Processing

Most of the operating systems supported by RomWBW provide a mechanism to
run commands at boot. This is similar to the AUTOEXEC.BAT files from
MS-DOS.

With the exception of ZPM3 and p-System, all operating systems will look
for a file called `PROFILE.SUB` on the system drive at boot. If it is
found, it will be processed as a standard CP/M submit file. You can read
about the use of the SUBMIT facility in the CP/M manuals included in
the RomWBW distribution. Note that the boot disk must also have a copy
of `SUBMIT.EXE`.

Note that the automatic startup processing generally requires booting
to a disk drive. Since the ROM disk is not writable, there is no
simple way to add/edit a `PROFILE.SUB` file there. If you want to
customize your ROM and add a `PROFILE.SUB` file to the ROM Disk, it
will work, but is a lot harder than using a boot disk.

In the case of ZPM3, the file called `STARTZPM.COM` will be run at
boot. To customize this file, you use the ZCPR ALIAS facility. You
will need to refer to ZCPR documentation for more information on the
ALIAS facility.

p-System has its own startup command processing mechanism that is
covered in the p-System documentation.

## NVRAM Configuration

See section [Setting NVRAM Options] for information about how to
apply NVRAM configuration.

## ROM Customization

The pre-built ROM images are configured for the basic capabilities of
each platform. Additionally, some of the typical add-on hardware for
each platform will be automatically detected and used. If you want to
go beyond this, RomWBW provides a very flexible configuration
mechanism based on configuration files. Creating a customized ROM
requires running a build script, but it is quite easy to do.

Essentially, the creation of a custom ROM is accomplished by updating
a small configuration file, then running a script to compile the
software and generate the custom ROM and disk images. There are build
scripts for Windows, Linux, and MacOS to accommodate virtually all
users. All required build tools (compilers, assemblers, etc.) are
included in the distribution, so it is not necessary to setup a build
environment on your computer.

RomWBW can be built on modern Windows, Linux, or MacOS computers.  The 
process for building a custom ROM is documented in the ReadMe.txt file 
in the Source directory of the distribution.  Any modern version of 
Windows (32-bit or 64-bit), MacOS, or Linux released in the last 10 
years should be able to run the build process.

For those who are interested in more than basic system customization,
note that all source code is provided (including the operating
systems). Modification of the source code is considered an expert
level task and is left to the reader to pursue.

Note that the ROM customization process does not apply to UNA. All
UNA customization is performed within the ROM setup script that is
built into the ROM.

## ROM User Application

The User App is provided as a way to access a custom written
ROM application.  In the pre-built ROMs, selecting User App will just
return to the Boot Loader menu.  If you are interested in creating a
custom application to run instead, review the "usrrom.asm" file in the
Source/HBIOS folder of the distribution.

# Upgrading

Upgrading to a newer release of RomWBW is essentially just a matter of
updating the ROM chip in your system. If you have spare ROM chips for
your system and a ROM programmer, it is always safest to retain your
existing, working ROM chip and program a new one with the new
firmware. If the new one fails to boot, you can easily return to the
known working ROM.

For each ROM that comes with the RomWBW distribution, you will find
that there are actually 3 different variants:

- `.rom` contains the complete ROM chip image
- `.upd` contains the system code, but omits the ROM Disk contents
- `.com` contains a CP/M executable version of the ROM code

So, for example, RCZ80_std contains the following files:

- `SBC_std.rom`
- `SBC_std.upd`
- `SBC_std.com`

The use of the `.com` variant is described below in [Application Boot].

As previously discussed, the ROM in most RomWBW systems contains both
the system code as well as a ROM Disk with files on it.  The `.rom`
variant of the ROM contains a full ROM chip image including both the
system code and the Rom Disk contents.  The `.upd` variant of the ROM
contains only the system code portion of the ROM.  If you apply the
`.upd` variant to your system, it will overlay the system code, but
will not overlay the ROM Disk contents (they remain intact).  You may
use either the `.rom` or the `.upd` file when updating your ROM chip
(this does not apply to Application Boot).  It is best to use the
`.rom` file for your upgrade because the files on your ROM Disk should
be updated whenever you update your system code.  The advantage of the
`.upd` variant is that is much smaller, so you can upload and apply it
faster.  The ROM update instructions below generally refer to using
the `.rom` variant.  However, you may substitute the `.upd` variant
if desired.

## Application Boot

Prior to attempting to reprogram your actual ROM chip, you may wish to
"try" the update to ensure it will work on your system. With RomWBW, you
can upload a new ROM image executable and load it from the command
line. For each ROM image file (.rom) in the Binary directory, you will
find a corresponding application file (.com). For example, for
SBC_std.rom, there is also an SBC_std.com file.

You can upload the `.com` file to your system using XModem, then simply 
run the `.com` file. You will see your system go through the normal 
startup process just like it was started from ROM. However, your 
physical ROM has not been updated and the next time you boot your 
system, it will revert to the system image contained in ROM.

Using this `.com` version of a ROM is an excellent way to confirm that
the new ROM code you intend to program will work correctly.  If it
does not, then you can just reboot and your old ROM will be loaded.

When the `.com` file is loaded, you will be taken to the normal
Boot Loader menu.  However, you will find that the only OS that is
available to boot from ROM is ZSDOS.  There is only room for a
single OS in the .com file.  Even if you don't normally use ZSDOS,
this will still confirm that your system operates well under the
new ROM code.

## Upgrading via Flash Utility

If you do not have easy access to a ROM programmer, it is usually
possible to reprogram your system ROM using the FLASH utility from
Will Sowerbutts. This application, called FLASH.COM, can be found on the
ROM drive of any running system. In this case, you would need to
transfer the new ROM image (.rom) over to your system using XModem (or
one of the other mechanisms described in the [Transferring Files]
section). The ROM image is too large to fit on your RAM drive,
so you will need to transfer it to a larger storage drive. Once the
ROM image is on your system, you can use the FLASH application to
update your ROM. The following is a typical example of transferring
ROM image using XModem and flashing the chip in-situ.

**NOTE**: The FLASH utility **can not** determine the type of your
ROM chip if it is write protected.  Additionally, it has no way to
determine if it is write protected.  If the FLASH utility
indicates it does not recognize your ROM chip, check to ensure the
chip is not write protected.

```
E>xm r rom.rom

Flash memory has 128 sectors of 4096 bytes, total 512KB
Write complete: Reprogrammed 2/128 sectors.
Verify (128 sectors) complete: OK!
```

Obviously, there is some risk to this approach since any issues with the
programming or ROM image could result in a non-functional system.

To confirm your ROM chip has been successfully updated, restart your
system and boot an operating system from ROM. Do not boot from a disk
device yet. Review the boot messages to see if any issues have
occurred.

## Upgrading via XModem Flash Updater

Similar to using the Flash utility, the system ROM can be updated
or upgraded through the ROM-based updater utility. This works by
reprogramming the flash ROM as the file is being transferred.

Using the ROM-based updater has the advantage that secondary storage is 
not required to hold the new image.  In other words, it is not
necessary to have a mass storage device available to store the
ROM image.

From the Boot Loader menu select X (Xmodem Flash Updater) and then
U (Begin Update). Then initiate the Xmodem transfer of the `.rom` file.
Since the XModem Flash Updater will be relatively slow, you may wish
to use the `.upd` varient of the ROM.

More information can be found in the ROM Applications document.

## Post Upgrade Update

Once you are satisfied that the ROM is working well, you will need to
update the system images and RomWBW custom applications on your disk
drives. The system images and custom applications are matched to the
RomWBW ROM firmware in use. If you attempt to boot a disk or run
applications that have not been updated to match the current ROM
firmware, you are likely to have odd problems.

The simplest way to update your disk media is to just use your modern
computer to overwrite the entire media with the latest disk image of
your choice. This process is described below in the [Disk Images]
section. If you wish to update existing disk media in your system, you
need to perform the following steps.

If the disk is bootable, you need to update the system image on the
disk using the procedure described in the [Operating Systems] section
of this document.

Finally, if you have copies of any of the RomWBW custom applications
on your hard disk, you need to update them with the latest copies. The
following applications are found on your ROM disk. Use COPY to copy
them over any older versions of the app on your disk:

* ASSIGN.COM
* SYSCOPY.COM
* MODE.COM
* FDU.COM
* FORMAT.COM
* XM.COM
* FLASH.COM
* FDISK80.COM
* TALK.COM
* RTC.COM
* TIMER.COM
* FAT.COM

For example: `B>COPY ASSIGN.COM C:`

Some RomWBW custom applications are too large to fit on the ROM disk.
If you are using any of these you will need to transfer them to your
system and then update all copies. These applications are found in
the Binary/Apps directory of the distribution and in all of the disk
images.

* TUNE.COM

The files normally contained on the standard ROM Disk is based on a 512K
ROM.  If your system has a smaller size ROM, then not all of these 
files will be included on your ROM Disk.  You will need to copy them to
your system from the /Binary/Apps folder of the RomWBW distribution.

**WARNING**: If you run a RomWBW-specific application that is not
the appropriate for the version of RomWBW you are running, the
application will generate an error message and abort.

## System Update

As previously described, a RomWBW ROM contains ROM applications as well 
as a ROM disk image.  If you are upgrading your ROM with a new patch 
level release, you may wish to upgrade just the application portion of 
the ROM.  This is referred to as a System Update.

If the system running ROMWBW utilizes the SST39SF040 Flash chip then it 
is possible to do a System Update in place of a System Upgrade in some 
cases.  A System Update would involve only updating the BIOS, ROM 
applications and ROM-hosted operating systems.

A System Update may be more favorable than a System Upgrade in cases
such as:

 - Overwriting of the ROM drive contents is not desired.
 - Temporary disk space is unavailable to hold a full ROM image.
 - To reduce the time taken to transfer and flash a full ROM.
 - Configuration changes are only minor and do not impact disk
   applications.

The RomWBW build process generates a system update file along with
the normal ROM image and can be identified by the extension ".upd". It
will be 128Kb in size. In comparison the normal ROM image will have
the extension ".rom" and be 512Kb or 1024Kb in size.

Transferring and flashing the System Update is accomplished in the same 
manner as described above in [Upgrading via Flash Utility] with the 
required difference being that the flash application needs to be 
directed to complete a partial flash using the /P command line switch.

`E>FLASH WRITE ROM.UPD /P`
