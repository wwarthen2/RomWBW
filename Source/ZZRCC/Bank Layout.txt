ZZRCC has no real ROM.  It has a single 512K RAM chip.  There
are two startup modes supported by RomWBW.

The normal startup mode treats the first 256KB like ROM and the second 
256KB as RAM.  The first 256KB (pseudo-ROM) must be preloaded by the 
ZZRCC CF Loader.  This mode simulates a normal ROM-based RomWBW
startup.

The ROMless startup mode treats the entire 512KB as RAM.  The entire
512KB of RAM (less the top 32KB) must be preloaded by the ZZRCC CF
Loader.  There will be no ROM disk available under RomWBW.  There
will be a RAM Disk and it's initial contents will be seeded by the
image loaded by the CF Loader.
