===== QP/M Disk for RomWBW =====

This disk contains the distribution files for the QP/M Operating
System.  The disk is bootable with QP/M already installed on the
system tracks.  The qpm.sys file and the QP/M image on the system
tracks was created using QINSTALL with default settings EXCEPT
for the two settings described under Notes (current drive/user
storage address and TIMDAT vector).

QINSTALL can be run again as desired to further customize your
installation.  However, note that QINSTALL does NOT remember prior
settings, so you must reapply all settings you made previously
especially the two setting changes described below.

This disk includes the standard DRI CP/M 2.2 files in addition to the
QP/M files.  QP/M generally assumes you already had DRI CP/M 2.2
prior to adding QP/M features.  Since QP/M does not replace all
features of CP/M 2.2, the CP/M 2.2 files are also included.

== Notes ==

By default, QP/M saves the current drive/user (2 byte value) at address 0x0008.
This is also the address of the Z80 RST 08 restart vector and conflicts with
RomWBW.  When running QINSTALL, you must change the QP/M address for this value
to something else.  I have been using 0x000E without issue.

RomWBW CBIOS has been modified to put the QP/M TIMDAT vector at 0x0010.  The
vector points into CBIOS where the actual TIMDAT routine is located.  The
TIMDAT routine reads the current date/time from HBIOS, changes the values from
BCD to binary, and rearranges some bytes for QP/M compatibilty.  When
running QINSTALL, you should set the TIMDAT vector to 0x0010 to
enabled QP/M to use your RomWBW real time clock.

By default, DEBUGZ utilizes the RST 38 restart vector for setting
code brakpoints.  This conflicts the use of that vector for any
system that is using interrupt mode 1.  DEBUGZ can be configured
(using DBGINST) to use a different vector.

The QSTAMP program, which is used to initialize a disk for date/time 
stamping, misbehavews when run on the (new) RomWBW 1024 directory 
format disks.  It creates an invalid directory entry for the date/time 
stamp data file.  This is definitely a QP/M issue.  The directory entry 
can be manually corrected.  Specifically the byte offset 15 should 
contain the number of 128-byte records in the file.  Instead, it is set 
to 0x01.  You can edit the entry, change it to 0x80 and everything
starts working.

There are two text files (QPMCMDS.TXT and QPMUTILS.TXT) included.  They
came from the original QP/M 2.7 distribution.  These files have
escape sequences imbedded in them which makes them look a little
strange depending on the terminal emulation you are using.

== QPM 2.7 Files ==

The following files came from the official QP/M distribution.  Actually,
they came from 3 Microcode Consulting files (qpm27.zip, debugz.zip,
and linkz.zip).  The original distribution files can be found on the
Microcode Consulting website at https://www.microcodeconsulting.com/.
Documentation (pdf) files are included in these original distribution
.zip files.  These documentation files have been included in the
RomWBW distribution in the Doc folder.

== CP/M 2.2 Files ==

provide various functionality that is not really available from the
ZSDOS applications themselves.  For example, the CP/M 2.2 application
called STAT is useful for modifying the IOBYTE.  Most of these
applications are documented in the "CPM Manual.pdf" document in the Doc
directory of the RomWBW distribution.

== Testing Applications (User Area 2) ==

User area 2 contains a variety of hardware testing applications.
These are generally user contributed and have no documentation.
Additionally, they are frequently not compatible with all RomWBW
hardware.  They are included here as a convenience.  If applicable,
your hardware documentation should refer to them and provide usage
instructions.

== Sample Tune Files (User Area 3) ==

User area 3 contains sample audio files that can be played using
the TUNE application.

== CP/NET 1.2 (User Area 4) ==

User area 4 contains a full implementation of the CP/NET 1.2
client provided by Doug Miller.  Please read the README.TXT file
in this user area for more information.

N.B., at a minimum, some of the files in this user area must be copied
to user area 0 for CP/NET to work properly.
