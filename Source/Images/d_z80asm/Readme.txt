===== Z80ASM v1.30 by SLR Systems =====

Z80ASM is a relocating macro assembler for CP/M. It takes assembly language
source statements from a disk file, converts them into their binary equivalent,
and stores the output in either a core-image, Intel hex format, or relocatable
object file. The mnemonics recognized are those of Zilog/Mostek. The optional
listing output may be sent to a disk file, the console and/or the printer, in
any combination. Output files may also be generated containing cross-reference
information on each symbol used.

The manual is available in the Doc directory,
