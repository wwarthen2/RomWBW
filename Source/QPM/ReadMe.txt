QPM27
-----

QPM is not available in source form.  In this folder, you will find
qcp27.dat and qdos27.dat.  These are the CCP and BDOS components for
QPM.  They were created by running QINSTALL on a normal RomWBW
CP/M 2.2 system, then extracting the resultant CCP and BDOS binaries.

When this folder goes through the build process, it just combines the
QPM CCP and BDOS binaries with the RomWBW CBIOS to create an up-to-date
QPM system image.

QPM 2.7 is distributed at https://www.microcodeconsulting.com/.
