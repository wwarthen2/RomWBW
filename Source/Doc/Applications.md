# Summary

RomWBW includes a small suite of custom applications to maximize the
features available. In general, these applications are operating
system agnostic -- they run under any of the included operating
systems. However, they all require RomWBW -- they are not generic CP/M
applications.

Most of the applications are custom written for RomWBW. However, some
are standard CP/M applications that have been adapted to run under
RomWBW (e.g., XModem). The applications are generally matched to the
version of RomWBW they are distributed with. So, if you upgrade the
version of RomWBW in your system ROM, you will want to copy the
corresponding applications to any storage devices you are using.

Most of the applications are included on the RomWBW ROM disk, so they
are easy to access.

The applications are also included with all of the operating system
disk images provided with RomWBW. So, a simple way to ensure you have
matching applications is to write the disk images onto your disk media
when upgrading your ROM. Of course, this will destroy any existing
data on your disk media, so don't do this if you are saving any data
on the media.

Most of the applications are included as source code in the RomWBW
distribution and are built in the normal build process. The source
code is found in the Source\\Apps directory of the distribution. The
binary executable applications are found in the Binary\\Apps directory.

# ASSIGN

RomWBW includes a flexible mechanism for associating the operating
system drive letters (A: - P:) to the physical devices in the system.
Drive letter assignments can be changed on a running operating system
without rebooting. The ASSIGN command facilitates this by allowing you
to display, assign, reassign, or remove the drive letter assignments.

## Syntax

| `ASSIGN /?`
| `ASSIGN /L`
| `ASSIGN [`*`<drv>`*`],...`
| `ASSIGN `*`<drv>`*`=[`*`<device>`*`:[`*`<slice>`*`]],...`
| `ASSIGN `*`<tgtdrv>`*`=`*`<srcdrv>`*`,...`

## Usage

`ASSIGN /?` will display brief command usage and version information.

`ASSIGN /L` will display a list of all the devices available to be
used in drive assignments in the running system. The devices listed
may or may not contain media. Although some device types support the
use of slices, the list does not indicate this.

`ASSIGN` with no parameters will list all of the current drive
assignments.

`ASSIGN `*`<drv>`* will display the assignment for the specific drive
For example, `ASSIGN C:` will display the assignment for drive C:.

`ASSIGN `*`<drv>`*`=`*`<device>`*`[:`*`<slice>`*`]` will assign (or
reassign) a drive letter to a new device and (optionally) slice. If no
slice is specified, then slice 0 is assumed. For example, `ASSIGN
C:=IDE0` will assign drive letter C: to device IDE0, slice 0. `ASSIGN
D:=IDE0:3` will assign drive letter D: to device IDE0 slice 3.

`ASSIGN `*`<drv>`*`=` can be used to remove the assignment from a
drive letter. So, `ASSIGN E:=` will remove the association of drive
letter E: from any previous device.

`ASSIGN `*`<tgtdrv>`*`=`*`<srcdrv>`* is used to swap the assignments
of two drive letters. For example, `ASSIGN C:=D:` will swap the device
assignments of C: and D:.

The `ASSIGN` command supports "stacking" of instructions. For example,
`ASSIGN C:=IDE0:0,D:=IDE0:1,E:=` will assign C: and D: to the first
two slices of IDE 0 and will unassign E:.

When the command runs it will echo the resultant assignments to the
console to confirm its actions. It will also display the remaining
space available in disk buffers.

## Notes

If the `ASSIGN` command encounters any rule violations or errors, it
will abort with an error and **none** of the drive assignments will be
implemented. In other words, the command is atomic and will either
completely succeed or completely fail.

All assigned drives utilize disk buffer space from a limited pool. The
ASSIGN command will display the amount of buffer space remaining
after an assign command is executed. Buffer space is freed if a drive
is unassigned. If the total assignments exceed the available disk
buffer space available, the command will abort with an error message.

The `ASSIGN` command does not check to see if the device and slice
being assigned actually contains readable media. If the assigned
device has no media, you will receive an I/O error when you attempt to
use the drive letter.

The `ASSIGN` command will not allow you to specify a slice (other than
zero) for devices that do not support slices (such as floppy drives
or RAM/ROM disks).

The `ASSIGN` command does not check that the media is large enough to
support the slice you specify. In other words, you could potentially
assign a drive letter to a slice that is beyond the end of the media
in a device. In this case, subsequent attempts to use that drive
letter will result in an I/O error.

Additionally, the `ASSIGN` command does not check to see if the slice
specified refers to an area on your media that is occupied by other
data (such as a FAT filesystem).

You will not be allowed to assign multiple drive letters to a single
device and slice. In other words, only one drive letter may refer to a
single filesystem at a time.

Drive letter A: must always be assigned to a device and slice. The
`ASSIGN` command will enforce this.

The changes made by this command are not permanent. The assignments
will persist through a warm start, but when you reboot your system,
all drive letters will return to their default assignments. A SUBMIT
batch file can be used to setup desired drive assignments
automatically at boot.

Floppy disk drives and RAM/ROM drives do not have slices. A slice
should only be specified for hard disk devices (SD, IDE, PPIDE).

Only one drive letter may be assigned to a specific device/unit/slice
at a time. Attempts to assign a duplicate drive letter will fail and
display an error. If you wish to assign a different drive letter to a
device/unit/slice, unassign the existing drive letter first.

Be aware that this command will allow you to reassign or remove the
assignment of your system drive letter. This can cause your operating
system to fail and force you to reboot.

The `ASSIGN` command does **not** prevent you from assigning a drive
letter to a slice that does not fit on the physical media.  However,
any subsequent attempt to refer to that drive letter will result in
an immediate OS error of "no disk".  Refer to "Hard Disk Capacity"
in the $doc_user$ for a discussion of the exact number of slices that
will fit on a specific physical disk size.

This command is particularly sensitive to being matched to the
appropriate version of the RomWBW ROM you are using. Be very careful
to keep all copies of `ASSIGN.COM` up to date with your ROM.

Additionally, the `ASSIGN` command must be able to adjust to CP/M 2.2
vs. CP/M 3.  If you utilize an RSX that modifies the BDOS version
returned, you are likely to have serious problems.  In this case, be
sure to use `ASSIGN` prior to loading the RSX or after it is unloaded.

## Etymology

The `ASSIGN` command is an original product and the source code is
provided in the RomWBW distribution.

# SYSCOPY

To make disk media bootable, you must write a system boot image onto
the system tracks of the of the media. The `SYSCOPY` allows you to
read or write the system boot image of disk media.

## Syntax

| `SYSCOPY `*`<dest>`*`=`*`<src>`*

*`<dest>`* is the drive to receive the operating system image or
alternatively a filename to save the operating system image

*`<src>`* is the drive containing an operating system image or
alternatively a filename containing the system image to be placed on
the destination

## Usage

Both *`<dest>`* and *`<src>`* can refer to either a drive letter or a
file. If a drive letter is specified, the system boot image will be
read or written to the system tracks of the drive. If a filename is
specified, the system boot image will be read or written to the
specified filename.

`SYSCOPY C:=ZSYS.SYS` will read a system boot image from the file
ZSYS.SYS and write it onto the system tracks of drive C:.

`SYSCOPY A:OS.SYS=C:` will capture the system boot image from the
system tracks of drive C: and store it in the file A:OS.SYS.

`SYSCOPY D:=C:` will copy the system tracks from drive C: onto the
system tracks of drive D:.

## Notes

The RomWBW ROM disk contains files with the system boot image for
Z-System and CP/M 2.2. These files are called CPM.SYS and ZSYS.SYS
respectively. These files can be used as the source of a `SYSCOPY`
command to make a disk bootable with the corresponding operating
system.

CP/M 3 uses a two phase boot process. To make a CP/M 3 drive bootable,
you need to put "CPMLDR.SYS" on the boot tracks of the disk and be
sure that the drive also contains the "CPM.SYS" file. The "CPMLDR.SYS"
file is not included on the ROM disk, but is found on the CP/M 3 disk
image.

ZPM3 is similar to CP/M 3. You also put "CPMLDR.SYS" on the system
tracks of the drive to make it bootable. The ZPM3 operating system is
in the file called "CPM3.SYS" on the ZPM3 disk image. It may seem
confusing that ZPM3 is in the file called CPM3.SYS, but it is normal
for ZPM3.

For the purposes of booting an operating system, each disk slice is
considered its own operating system. Each slice can be made bootable
with its own system tracks.

`SYSCOPY` uses drive letters to specify where to read/write the system
boot images. However, at startup, the boot loaded will require you to
enter the actual disk device and slice to boot from. So, you need to
be careful to pay attention to the device and slice that is assigned
to a drive letter so you will know what to enter at the boot loader
prompt. By way of explanation, the boot loader does not know about
drive letters because the operating system is not loaded yet.

If you want to put a boot system image on a device and slice that is
not currently assigned to a drive letter, you will need to assign a
drive letter first.

Not all disk formats include space for system tracks. Such disk
formats cannot contains a system boot image and, therefore, cannot be
made bootable. The best example of such disk formats are the ROM and
RAM disks. To maximize usable file space on these drives, they do not
have system tracks. Obviously, ROM operating system is supported by
choosing a ROM operating system at the boot loader prompt. Any attempt
to write a system boot image to disk media with no system tracks will
cause SYSCOPY to fail with an error message.

The system boot images are paired with the ROM version in your system.
So, you must take care to update the system tracks of any bootable
disk when you upgrade your ROM firmware.

The system boot images are **not** tied to specific hardware
configurations. System boot images and operating systems provided with
RomWBW will work with any supported RomWBW platform or hardware as
long as they are the same version as the RomWBW firmware.

## Etymology

The `SYSCOPY` command is an original product and the source code is
provided in the RomWBW distribution.

# MODE

The MODE command allows you to adjust the operating characteristics
such as baud rate, data bits, stop bits, and parity bits of serial
ports dynamically.

## Syntax

`MODE /?`
`MODE COM`*`<n>`*`: [`*`<baud>`*`[,`*`<parity>`*`[,`*`<databits>`*`[,`*`<stopbits>`*`]]]] [/P]`

`/?` displays command usage and version information

*`<n>`* is the character device unit number

*`<baud>`* is numerical baudrate

*`<parity>`* is (N)one, (O)dd, (E)ven, (M)ark, or (S)pace

*`<databits>`* is number of data bits, typically 7 or 8

*`<stopbits>`* is number of stop bits, typically 1 or 2

`/P` prompts user prior to setting new configuration

## Usage

`MODE /?` will display basic command usage and version information.

`MODE` with no parameters will list all devices and their current
configuration.

`MODE <`*n*`>` will display the current configuration of the specified
character device unit.

`MODE COM`*`<n>`*`: [`*`<baud>`*`[,`*`<parity>`*`[,`*`<databits>`*`[,`
*`<stopbits>`*`]]]] [/P]` requests that the specified configuration
be set on the character device unit. You can use commas with no values
to leave some values unchanged. As an example, `MODE COM0: 9600,,,2`
will setup character device unit 0 for 9600 baud and 2 stop bits while
leaving data bits and stop bits as is.

Appending `/P` in a command specifying a new configuration will cause
the terminal output to pause and wait for the user to press a key.
This allows the user to change the local terminal setup before
continuing.

## Notes

Specified baud rate and line characteristics must be supported by the
serial unit. Any parameters not specified will remain unchanged.

Changes are not persisted and will revert to system defaults at next
system boot.

Not all character devices support all `MODE` options. Some devices
(notably ASCI devices) have limited baud rate divisors. An attempt to
set a baud rate that the device cannot support will fail with an error
message.

## Etymology

The `MODE` command is an original product and the source code is
provided in the RomWBW distribution.

# FDU

The FDU application is a Floppy Disk Utility that provides functions
to format and test floppy disk media.

## Syntax

`FDU`

## Usage

This application has an interactive user interface. At startup, you
will be prompted to select the floppy interface hardware in your
system. Following this, you will see the main menu of the program with
many functions to manage floppy disk drives.

The primary documentation for this application is in a file called
"FDU.txt" in the Doc directory of the RomWBW distribution. Please
consult this file for usage information.

## Notes

This application interfaces directly to the floppy hardware in your
system. It does not use the RomWBW HBIOS. This means that even if your
system is not configured for floppy drives, you can still use `FDU`
to test your floppy drives and format floppy media. This also means it
is critical that you choose the correct hardware interface from the
initial selection when starting the application.

## Etymology

The `FDU` command is an original product and the source code is
provided in the RomWBW distribution.

`\clearpage`{=latex}

# FORMAT

This application is just a placeholder for a future version that will
make it simpler to format media including floppy disks.

## Syntax

`FORMAT`

## Notes

This application currently just displays a few lines of information
briefly instructing a user how to format media. It performs no actual
function beyond this display currently.

## Etymology

The `FORMAT` command is an original product and the source code is
provided in the RomWBW distribution.

`\clearpage`{=latex}

# XM

An adaptation of Ward Christensen's X-Modem protocol for transferring
files between systems using a serial port.

## Syntax

| `XM S `*`<filename>`*
| `XM SK `*`<filename>`*
| `XM L `*`<library> <filename>`*
| `XM LK `*`<library> <filename>`*
| `XM R `*`<filename>`*

`S`: Send a file
`L`: Send a file from a library
`R`: Receive a file
`K`: Use 1K blocksize for transfer

*`<filename>`* is the name of a file to send or receive

*`<library>`* is the name of a library (.lbr) to extract a file to send

## Usage

To transfer a file from your host computer to your RomWBW computer, do
the following:

1. Enter one of the `XM` receive commands specifying the name you want
to give to the received file.

2. On your host computer select a file to send and initiate the XModem
send operation.

To transfer a file from your RomWBW computer to your host computer, do
the following:

1. Enter one of the `XM` send commands specifying the name of the file
to be sent.

2. On your host computer, specify the name to assign to the received
file and initiate and XModem receive operation.

Please refer to the documentation of your host computer's terminal
emulation software for specific instructions on how to use XModem.

## Notes

The XModem adaptation that comes with RomWBW will automatically use
the primary character device unit (character device unit 0) for the
file transfer.

`XM` attempts to determine the best way to drive the serial port based
on your hardware configuration. When possible, it will bypass the
HBIOS for faster operation. However, in many cases, it will use HBIOS
so that flow control can be used.

`XM` is dependent on a reliable communications channel. You must
ensure that the serial port can be serviced fast enough by either
using a baud rate that is low enough or ensuring that hardware flow
control is fully functional (end to end).

## Etymology

The `XM` application provided in RomWBW is an adaptation of a
pre-existing XModem application. Based on the source code comments, it
was originally adapted from Ward Christensen's MODEM2 by Keith
Petersen and is labelled version 12.5.

The original source of the application was found in the Walnut Creek
CD-ROM and is called XMDM125.ARK dated 7/15/86.

The actual application is virtually untouched in the RomWBW
adaptation. The majority of the work was in the modem driver which was
enhanced to detect the hardware being used and dynamically choose the
appropriate driver.

The source code is provided in the RomWBW distribution.

# FLASH

Most of the hardware platforms that run RomWBW support the use of
EEPROMs -- Electronically Erasable Programmable ROMs. The `FLASH`
application can be used to reprogram such ROMS in-situ (in-place),
thus making it possible to upgrade ROMs without a programmer or even
removing the ROM from your system.

This application is provided by Will Sowerbutts.

## Syntax

| `FLASH READ `*`<filename>`*` [options]`
| `FLASH VERIFY `*`<filename>`*` [options]`
| `FLASH WRITE `*`<filename>`*` [options]`

*`<filename>`* is the filename of the ROM image file

FLASH4 will auto-detect most parameters so additional options should not
normally be required.

Options:

| `/V`: Enable verbose output (one line per sector)
| `/P` or `/PARTIAL`: Allow flashing a large ROM from a smaller image file
| `/ROM`: Allow read-only use of unknown chip types
| `/Z180DMA`: Force Z180 DMA engine
| `/UNABIOS`: Force UNA BIOS bank switching
| `/ROMWBW`: Force RomWBW (v2.6+) bank switching
| `/ROMWBWOLD`: Force RomWBW (v2.5 and earlier) bank switching
| `/P112`: Force P112 bank switching
| `/N8VEMSBC`: Force N8VEM SBC (v1, v2), Zeta (v1) SBC bank switching

## Usage

To program your EEPROM ROM chip, first transfer the file to your
RomWBW system. Then use the command `FLASH WRITE *`<filename>`*. The
application will auto-detect the type of EEPROM chip you have,
program it, and verify it.

You can use the `FLASH READ` form of the command to read the ROM image
from your system into a file. This is useful if you want to save a
copy of your current ROM before reprogramming it.

Although `FLASH WRITE` automatically performs a verification, you can
manually perform a verification function with the `FLASH VERIFY` form
of the command.

The author's documentation for the application is found in the RomWBW
distribution in the Doc/Contrib directory.

## Notes

The application supports a significant number of EEPROM parts. It
should automatically detect your part. If it does not recognize your
chip, make sure that you do not have a write protect jumper set --
this jumper can prevent the ROM chip from being recognized.

Reprogramming a ROM chip in-place is inherently dangerous. If anything
goes wrong, you will be left with a non-functional system and no
ability to run the `FLASH` application again. Use this application
with caution and be prepared to use a hardware ROM programmer to
restore your system if needed.

## Etymology

This application was written and provided by Will Sowerbutts. He
provides it in binary format and is included in the RomWBW
distribution as a binary file.

The source code for this application can be found at the [FLASH4
GitHub repository](https://github.com/willsowerbutts/flash4).

# FDISK80

`FDISK80` allows you to create and manage traditional partitions on
your hard disk media.  Depending on the hard disk format and features
you are using, RomWBW may need hard disk partitions defined.

Please refer to the $doc_user$ for more information on the use of
partitions within RomWBW.  It is very important to understand that
RomWBW slices are completely different from disk partitions.

This application is provided by John Coffman.  The primary
documentation is in the file "FDisk Manual.pdf" found in the
Doc directory of the RomWBW distribution.

## Usage

`FDISK80` is an interactive application. At startup it will ask you
for the disk unit that you want to partition. When your RomWBW system
boots, it will display a table with the disk unit numbers. Use the
disk unit numbers from that table to enter the desired disk unit to
partition.

`FDISK80` operates very much like other FDISK disk partitioning
applications. Please refer to the file called "FDisk Manual.pdf" in
the Doc directory of the RomWBW distribution for further instructions.

There is also more information on using FAT partitions with RomWBW in
the $doc_user$ document in the Doc directory of the distribution.

## Notes

Hard disk partition tables allow a maximum of 1024 cylinders when
defining partitions.  However, RomWBW uses exclusively Logical Block
Addressing (LBA) which does not have this limitation.  When defining
partitions is usually best to define the start and size of of the
partition using bytes or sectors.

## Etymology

The source for this application was provided directly by John Coffman.
It is a C program and requires a build environment that includes the
SDCC compiler. As such, it is not included in the RomWBW build
process, only the binary executable is included.

Please contact John Coffman if you would like a copy of the source.

# TALK

It is sometimes useful to direct your console input/output to a
designated serial port.  For example, if you were to connect a modem
to your second serial port, you might want to connect directly to it
and have everything you type sent to it and everything it sends be
shown on your console.  The `TALK` application does this.

## Syntax

`TALK [TTY:|CRT:|BAT:UC1:]`

## Usage

`TALK` operates at the operating system level (not HBIOS).

The parameter to `TALK` refers to logical CP/M serial devices.  Upon
execution all characters typed at the console will be sent to the
device specified and all characters received by the specified device
will be echoed on the console.

Press Control+Z on the console to terminate the application.

## Notes

This application is designed for CP/M 2.2 or Z-System.  Use on later
operating systems such as CP/M 3 is not supported.

## Etymology

The `TALK` command is an original product and the source code is
provided in the RomWBW distribution.

`\clearpage`{=latex}

# HTALK

`HTALK` is a variation of the `TALK` utility, but it works directly
against HBIOS Character Units.

## Syntax

`HTALK COMn:`

## Usage

`HTALK` operates at the HBIOS level.

The parameter to `TALK` refers to a HBIOS character unit.  Upon
execution all characters typed at the console will be sent to the
device specified and all characters received by the specified device
will be echoed on the console.

Press Control+Z on the console to terminate the application.

## Notes


## Etymology

The `TALK` command was created and donated to RomWBW by Tom Plano.  It
is an original product designed specifically for RomWBW.

`\clearpage`{=latex}

# RTC

Many RomWBW systems provide real time clock hardware.  The RTC
application is a simple, interactive program allowing you to display
and set the time and registers of the RTC.

## Syntax

`RTC`

## Usage

After startup, the application provides the following options:

| Option      | Function                                               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `E)xit`     | will terminate the application.                        |
| `T)ime`     | will display the time as read from the RTC hardware.   |
| `st(A)rt`   | will restart the clock running if it is stopped.       |
| `S)et`      | will program the RTC clock with the date/time previously entered using the I)nit option. |
| `R)aw`      | will read the minute/second of the RTC clock iteratively every time the space key is pressed.  Press enter to end. |
| `L)oop`     | will read the full date/time of the RTC clock iteratively every time the space key is pressed.  Press enter to end. |
| `C)harge`   | will enable the battery charging function of the RTC.  |
| `N)ocharge` | will disable the battery charging function of the RTC. |
| `D)elay`    | allows you to test the built-in timing delay in the program.  It is not unusual for it to be wrong. |
| `I)nit`     | allows you to enter a date/time value for subsequent programming of the RTC using the S)et option. |
| `G)et`      | allows you to read the value of a non-volatile register in the RTC. |
| `P)ut`      | allows you to write the value of a non-volatile register in the RTC. |
| `B)oot`     | will reboot your system.                               |
| `H)elp`     | displays brief help.                                   |

## Notes

When using Get and Put options, the register number to read/write is
entered in hex.  The non-volatile ram register numbers are 0x20-0x3F.

When entering values, you must enter exactly two hex characters.  The
backspace key is not supported.  You do not use enter after entering
the two hex characters.  Yes, this should be improved.

The `RTC` application interacts directly with the RTC hardware
bypassing HBIOS.

## Etymology

The `RTC` application was originally written by Andrew Lynch as part of
the original ECB SBC board development.  It has since been modified to
support most of the hardware variations included with RomWBW.

# TIMER

Most RomWBW systems have a 50Hz periodic system timer.  A counter is
incremented every time a timer tick occurs.  The `TIMER` application
displays the value of the counter.

## Syntax

`TIMER`
`TIMER /?`
`TIMER /C`

## Usage

Use `TIMER` to display the current value of the counter.

Use `TIMER /C` to display the value of the counter continuously.

The display of the counter will be something like this:

`00045444 Ticks, 0000162A.10 Seconds`

The first number is the total number of ticks since system startup.
The second number is the total number of seconds since system startup.

## Notes

The seconds value is displayed with a fractional value which is not a
an actual fraction, but rather the number of ticks past the seconds
rollover.  All values are in hex.

The primary use of the `TIMER` application is to test the system
timer functionality of your system.

In theory, you could capture the value before and after some process
you want to time.

## Etymology

The `TIMER` command is an original product and the source code is
provided in the RomWBW distribution.

`\clearpage`{=latex}

# INTTEST

RomWBW includes an API allowing applications to "hook" interrupts.
The `INTTEST` application allows you to test this functionality.

## Syntax

`INTTEST`

## Usage

`INTTEST` is an interactive application.  At startup, it will display
a list of the interrupt vector slots in your system along with the
current vector address for each of them.

It then prompts you to enter the slot number (in hex) of a vector to
hook.  After entering this, the application will watch the hooked
vector and countdown from 0xFF to 0x00 as interrupts are noted.

When the counter reaches 0x00, the interrupt is unhooked and the
application terminates.  The application can also be terminated by
pressing <esc>.

## Notes

If your system is running without interrupts active, the application
will terminate immediately.

All slots have vectors even if the corresponding interrupt is not
doing anything.  In this case, the vector is pointing to the "bad
interrupt" handler.

If you hook a vector that is not receiving any interrupts, the
downcounter will not do anything.

## Etymology

The `INTTEST` command is an original product and the source code is
provided in the RomWBW distribution.

# FAT

The operating systems included with RomWBW do not have any native
ability to access MS-DOS FAT filesystems. The FAT application can be
used overcome this. It will allow you to transfer files between CP/M
and FAT filesystems (wildcards supported). It can also erase files,
format, and list directories of FAT filesystems.

## Syntax

| `FAT DIR `*`<path>`*
| `FAT COPY `*`<src> <dst>`*
| `FAT REN `*`<from> <to>`*
| `FAT DEL `*`<path>[<file>|<dir>]`*
| `FAT MD `*`<path>`*
| `FAT FORMAT `*`<drv>`*

| *`<path>`* is a FAT path
| *`<src>`*, *`<dst>`* are FAT or CP/M filenames
| *`<from>`*, *`<to>`* are FAT filenames
| *`<file>`* is a FAT filename
| *`<dir>`* is a FAT directory name
| *`<drv>`* is a RomWBW disk unit number

| CP/M filespec: *`<d>`*`:FILENAME.EXT` (*`<d>`* is CP/M drive letter A-P)
| FAT filespec: *`<u>`*`:/DIR/FILENAME.EXT` (*`<u>`* is RomWBW disk unit #)

## Usage

The `FAT` application determines whether you are referring to a CP/M
filesystem or a FAT filesystem based on the way you specify the file
or path. If the file or path is prefixed with a number (n:), then it
is assumed this is a FAT filesystem reference and is referring to the
FAT filesystem on RomWBW disk unit 'n'. Otherwise, the file
specification is assumed to be a normal CP/M file specification.

If you wanted to list the directory of the FAT filesystem on RomWBW
disk unit 2, you would use `FAT DIR 2:`. If you only wanted to see the
".TXT" files, you would use `FAT DIR 2:*.TXT`.

If you wanted to copy all of the files on CP/M drive B: to the FAT
filesystem on RomWBW disk unit 4, you would use the command `FAT COPY
B:*.* 4:` If you wanted to copy the files to the "FOO" directory, then
you would use `FAT COPY B:*.* 4:\FOO`. To copy files in the opposite
direction, you just reverse the parameters.

To rename the file "XXX.DAT" to "YYY.DAT" on a FAT filesystem, you
could use a command like "FAT REN 2:XXX.DAT 2:YYY.DAT".

To delete a file "XXX.DAT" on a FAT filesystem in directory "FOO", you
would use a command like `FAT DEL 2:\FOO\XXX.DAT`.

To make a directory called "FOO2" on a FAT filesystem, you would use a
command line `FAT MD 2:\FOO2`.

To format the filesystem on a FAT partition, you would use a command
like `FAT FORMAT 2:`. Use this with caution because it will destroy
all data on any pre-existing FAT filesystem on disk unit 2.

## Notes

Partitioned or non-partitioned media is handled automatically. A
floppy drive is a good example of a non-partitioned FAT filesystem and
will be recognized. Larger media will typically have a partition
table which will be recognized by the application to find the FAT
filesystem.

Although RomWBW-style CP/M media does not know anything about
partition tables, it is entirely possible to have media that has both
CP/M and FAT file systems on it. This is accomplished by creating a
FAT filesystem on the media that starts on a track beyond the last
track used by CP/M. Each CP/M slice on a media will occupy 8,320K
(16,640 sectors). So, make sure to start your FAT partition beyond (<
slice count> * 8,320K) or (<slice count * 16,640 sectors).

The application infers whether you are attempting to reference a FAT
or CP/M filesystem via the drive specifier (char before ':'). A
numeric drive character specifies the HBIOS disk unit number for FAT
access. An alpha (A-P) character indicates a CP/M file system access
targeting the specified drive letter. If there is no drive character
specified, the current CP/M filesystem and current CP/M drive is
assumed. For example:

| `2:README.TXT` refers to FAT file "README.TXT" on disk unit #2
| `C:README.TXT` refers to CP/M file "README.TXT" on CP/M drive C
| `README.TXT` refers to CP/M file "README.TXT" on the current CP/M
drive

Files with SYS, HIDDEN, or R/O only attributes are not given any
special treatment. Such files are found and processed like any other
file. However, any attempt to write to a read-only file will fail and
the application will abort.

It is not currently possible to reference CP/M user areas other than
the current user. To copy files to alternate user areas, you must
switch to the desired user number first or use an additional step to
copy the file to the desired user area.

Accessing FAT filesystems on a floppy requires the use of RomWBW HBIOS
v2.9.1-pre.13 or greater.

Files written are not verified.

Wildcard matching in FAT filesystems is a bit unusual as implemented by
FatFs. See FatFs documentation.

## Etymology

The `FAT` application is an original RomWBW work, but utilizes the
FsFat library for all of the FAT filesystem work. This application is
written in C and requires SDCC to compile. As such it is not part of
the RomWBW build process. However, the full project and source code is
found in the [FAT GitHub Repository](https://github.com/wwarthen/FAT).

## Known Issues

CP/M (and workalike) OSes have significant restrictions on filename
characters.  The FAT application will block any attempt to create a
file on the CP/M filesystem containing any of these prohibited
characters:

|         `< > . , ; : = ? * [ ] _ % | ( ) / \`

The operation will be aborted with "`Error: Invalid Path Name`" if such
a filename character is encountered.

Since MS-DOS does allow some of these characters, you can have
issues when copying files from MS-DOS to CP/M if the MS-DOS filenames
use these characters.  Unfortunately, FAT is not yet smart enough to
substitute illegal characters with legal ones.  So, you will need to
clean the filenames before trying to copy them to CP/M.

The FAT application does try to detect the scenario where you are
copying a file to itself.  However, this detection is not perfect and
can corrupt a file if it occurs.  Be careful to avoid this.

# TUNE

If your RomWBW system has a sound card based on either an AY-3-8190 or
YM2149F sound chip, you can use the `TUNE` application to play PT or
MYM sound files.

## Syntax

`TUNE `*`<filename>`*

*`<filename>`* is the name of a sound file ending in .PT2, .PT3, or
.MYM

## Usage

The TUNE application supports PT and YM sound file formats. It
determines the format of the file from the extension of the file, so
your tune filenames should end in .PT2, .PT3, or .MYM.

To play a sound file, just use the command and specify the file to
play after the command. So, for example, `TUNE ATTACK.PT2` will
immediately begin playing the PT sound file "ATTACK.PT2".

## Notes

The `TUNE` application automatically probes for compatible hardware at
well known port addresses at startup. It will auto-configure itself
for the hardware found. If no hardware is detected, it will abort with
an error message.

On Z180 systems, I/O wait states are added when writing to the sound
chip to avoid exceeding its speed limitations. On Z80 systems, you
will need to ensure that the CPU clock speed of your system does not
exceed the timing limitations of your sound chip.

The application probes for an active system timer and uses it to
accurately pace the sound file output. If no system timer is
available, a delay loop is calculated instead. The delay loop will not
be as accurate as the system timer.

There are two modes of operations.  A direct hardware interface for the
AY-3-8910 or YM2149 chips, or a compatibility layer thru HBIOS supporting
the SN76489 chip.

By default the application will attempt to interface directly to the sound
chip.  The optional argument `--hbios` supplied after the filename, will
enable the application to use the HBIOS sound driver.

The HBIOS mode also support other switch as described below.

| Switch      | Description                                            |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
|  `--hbios`  | Utilise HBIOS' sound driver                            |
| `+t1`       | Play tune an octave higher                             |
| `+t2`       | Play tune two octaves higher                           |
| `-t1`       | Play tune an octave lower                              |
| `-t2`       | Play tune two octaves lower                            |

All RomWBW operating system boot disks include a selection of sound
files in user area 3.

## Etymology

The `TUNE` application was custom written for RomWBW. All of the
hardware interface code is specific to RomWBW. The sound file decoding
software was adapted and embedded from pre-existing sources. The YM
player code is from MYMPLAY 0.4 by Lieves!Tuore and the PT player code
is (c)2004-2007 S.V.Bulba <vorobey@mail.khstu.ru>.

The source code is provided in the RomWBW distribution.

# CPUSPD

The `CPUSPD` application is used to change the running speed and wait
states of a RomWBW system.

  The functionality is highly dependent on
the capabilities of your system.

At present, all Z180 systems can change their CPU speed and their
wait states.  SBC and MBC systems may be able to change their CPU
speed if the hardware supports it and it is enabled in the HBIOS
configuration.

## Syntax

| `CPUSPD [`*`<speed>`*`[,[`*`<memws>`*`][,[`*`<iows>`*`]]]`

*`<speed>`* is one of HALF, FULL, or DOUBLE.  
*`<memws>`* is a number specifying the desired memory wait states.  
*`<iows>`* is a number specifying the desired I/O wait states.

## Usage

Entering `CPUSPD` with no parameters will display the current CPU speed
and wait state information of the running system.  Wait state
information is not available for all systems.

To modify the running speed of a system, you can specify the
`*`<speed>`*` parameter.  To modify either or both of the wait
states, you can enter the desired number.  Either or both of the wait
state parameters may be omitted and the current wait state settings
will remain in effect.

## Notes

The ability to modify the running speed and wait states of a system
varies widely depending on the hardware capabilities and the HBIOS
configuration settings.

Note that it is frequently impossible to tell if a system is capable
of dynamic speed changes.  This function makes the changes blindly.
If an attempt is made to change the speed of a system
that is definitely incapable of doing so, then an error result is
returned.

The `CPUSPD` command makes no attempt to ensure that the new CPU
speed will actually work on the current hardware.  Setting a CPU
speed that exceeds the capabilities of the system will result in
unstable operation or a system stall.

Some peripherals are dependent on the CPU speed.  For example, the Z180
ASCI baud rate and system timer are derived from the CPU speed.  The
CPUSPD application will attempt to adjust these peripherals for
correct operation after modifying the CPU speed.  However, in some
cases this may not be possible.  The baud rate of ASCI ports have a
limited set of divisors.  If there is no satisfactory divisor to
retain the existing baud rate under the new CPU speed, then the baud
rate of the ASCI port(s) will be affected.

## Etymology

The `CPUSPD` application was custom written for RomWBW. All of the
hardware interface code is specific to RomWBW and the application will
not operate correctly on non-RomWBW systems.

The source code is provided in the RomWBW distribution.

# VGMPLAY

This application will allow you to play Video Game Music files. VGM 
files contain music samples from a range of different sound chips 
that were used in arcade games, game consoles and personal computer 
systems.

Video Game Music files have a .VGM file extension and each file 
contains an embedded header that identifies the hardware it is 
intended for and also the title of the music.

All RomWBW operating system boot disks include a selection of sound
files in user area 3. Additional music files can be found at:

[VGMRIPS website](https://vgmrips.net)

[PROJECT2612 website](https://project2612.org/)

Sound files are loaded into memory for playback, so the maximum size
file that can be played is around 52Kb.

Sound chips currently supported are:

* AY-3-8190 (and equivalent YM2149)
* YM2612 (and equivalent YM3848)
* SN76489 (single chip mono and dual chip stereo)
* YM2151 

VGMPLAY supports playback of files with multiple combinations of these
chips.

## Syntax

`VGMPLAY `*`<filename>`*

*`<filename>`* is the name of a sound file ending in .VGM

## Usage

VGMPLAY does not automatically detect the hardware platform or sound
hardware that you are using. This means a version customized for your
system must be assembled before use.

To play a sound file, just use the VGMPLAY command and specify the file
to play after the command. So, for example, `VGMPLAY TEDDY` will load
the TEDDY.VGM sound file into memory and begin playing it.

Playback can be stopped by pressing a key. There may be a delay before
playback stops.

## Notes

The default build configuration for VGMPLAY is:

CPU speed: Autodetected

| chip      | number  | port     | notes
| --------- | ------- | -------- | ----------
| AY-3-8910 |  1st    | 09ah     | stereo
| AY-3-8910 |  2nd    | not set  | stereo
| YM2612    |  1st    | 0c0h     | stereo
| YM2612    |  2nd    | 0c4h     | stereo
| SN76489   |  1st    | 0c8h     | mono/left
| SN76489   |  2nd    | 0c9h     | mono/right
| YM2151    |  1st    | 0cah     | stereo
| YM2151    |  2nd    | 0cbh     | stereo

Inconsistant, garbled or distorted playback can be an indication that
your CPU clock speed is too high for your sound chip. In this case, if 
your platform supports speed switching, then the CPUSPD application 
can be used to reduce your processor speed.

VGMPLAY is still under development. The source code is provided in the 
RomWBW distribution.

# WDATE

`wdate` is a utility for CP/M systems that have Wayne Warthen's
ROMWBW firmware. It reads or sets the real-time clock, using function
calls in the BIOS. It should work on any RTC device that is supported by
ROMWBW, including the internal interrupt-driven timer that is is available
on some systems. 

`wdate` differs from the `rtc.com` utility that is provided with the
ROMWBW version of CP/M in that it only gets and sets the date/time. 
`rtc.com` can also manipulate the nonvolatile RAM in certain clock
devices, and modify the charge controller. However, `wdate` is (I would
argue) easier to use, as it takes its input from the command line, which
can be edited, and it's less fussy about the format. It doesn't require
the date to be set if you only want to change the time, for example.
 In addition, `wdate` has at least some error checking.

`wdate` displays the day-of-week and month as English text, not 
numbers. It calculates the day-of-week from the year, month, and day.
RTC chips usually store a day-of-week value, but it's useless in this
application for two reasons: first, the BIOS does not expose it. Second,
there is no universally-accepted way to interpret it (which day does
the week start on? Is '0' a valid day of the week?)

## Syntax

| `WDATE`
| `WDATE ` *`<hr> <min>`*
| `WDATE ` *`<hr> <min> <sec>`*
| `WDATE ` *`<year> <month> <day> <hr> <min> <sec>`*

## Usage

    A> wdate
    Saturday 27 May 13:14:39 2023

With no arguments, displays the current date and time. 

    A> wdate hr min

With two arguments, sets the time in hours and minutes, without changing date
or seconds

    A> wdate hr min sec

With three arguments, sets the time in hours, minutes, and seconds, without
changing date

    A> wdate year month day hr min sec

With six arguments, sets date and time. All numbers are one or two digits.  The
two-digit year starts at 2000. 

    A> wdate /?

Show a summary of the command-line usage.

## Notes

I've tested this utility with the DS1302 clock board designed by Ed 
Brindly, and on the interrupt-driven timer built into my Z180 board. 
However, it does not interact with hardware, only BIOS; I would expect 
it to work with other hardware.

wdate checks for the non-existence of ROMWBW, and also for failing 
operations on the RTC. It will display the terse "No RTC" message in 
both cases.

The ROMWBW functions that manipulate the date and time operate on BCD 
numbers, as RTC chips themselves usually do. wdate works in decimal, so 
that it can check that the user input makes sense. A substantial part of
the program's code is taken up by number format conversion and range 
checking.

## Etymology

The `WDATE` application was written and contributed by Kevin Boone.
