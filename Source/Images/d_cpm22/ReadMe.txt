===== CP/M-80 2.2 Disk for RomWBW =====

This disk is one of several ready-to-run disks provided with RomWBW.
It contains a vanilla distribution of DRI's CP/M-80 2.2 adapted for
RomWBW.  The disk is bootable as is (the operating system image is
already embedded in the system tracks) and can be launched from the
RomWBW Loader prompt.

The remainder of this document describes the usage and contents of
this disk.  It is highly recommended that you review the "RomWBW
User Guide.pdf" document found in the Doc directory of the
RomWBW Distribution.

== Usage ==

  - All installation steps needed to run CP/M 2.2 have already been
    performed.  It is not necessary to perform the steps in the
    Alteration section of the CPM Manual.
  - The MOVCPM application referred to in the manual is not needed
    with RomWBW and is not included.
  - The manual refers to the use of SYSGEN to install a copy of CP/M 2.2
    on the boot tracks of a disk to make it bootable.  Under RomWBW, it
    is recommended that you use SYSCOPY instead.  SYSGEN is included,
    but SYSCOPY is more flexible.  The use of SYSCOPY is documented in
    the RomWBW Applications document.

== Notes ==

  - SUBMIT.COM has been patched per the official DRI patch list such
    that the submit file will always be placed on the A: drive which
    ensures it will be run properly even if your default drive is not
    currently A:.
  - DDT, DDTZ, and ZSID have been patched to use RST 6 instead of the
    original RST 7 vector for single step debugging.  This is mandatory
    for a Z80 CPU which uses RST 7 for hardware interrupts.
  - CP/M 2.2 was not distributed with a help system.  Douglas Miller
    has adapted the CP/M 3 help system for CP/M 2.2 and is included.
    The HELP.HLP data file must be found on the current default drive
    and user area when HELP.COM is run.

== CP/M 2.2 Files ==

The following CP/M 2.2 files were distributed by DRI with the operating
system or as supplemental add-on programs.  They are documented in the
"CP/M Manual.pdf" document in the Doc directory of the Rom WBW
distribution.  MAC, RMAC, ZSID are supplemental programs from DRI
with separate standalone documentation which is not included in the
RomWBW package (but easily found on the Internet via Google search).

== Testing Applications (User Area 2) ==

User area 2 contains a variety of hardware testing applications.
These are generally user contributed and have no documentation.

N.B., these applications are frequently not compatible with all RomWBW
hardware.  They are included here as a convenience.  If applicable,
your hardware documentation should refer to them and provide usage
instructions.

== Sample Tune Files (User Area 3) ==

User area 3 contains sample audio files that can be played using
the TUNE application.

== CP/NET 1.2 (User Area 4) ==

User area 4 contains a full implementation of the CP/NET 1.2
client provided by Doug Miller.  Please read the README.TXT file
in this user area for more information.

N.B., at a minimum, some of the files in this user area must be copied
to user area 0 for CP/NET to work properly.
