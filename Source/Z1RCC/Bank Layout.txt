Z1RCC has no real ROM.  It has a single 512K RAM chip.  The RomWBW
ROMless startup mode is used.

The ROMless startup mode treats the entire 512KB as RAM.  The entire 
512KB of RAM (less the top 32KB) must be preloaded by the Z1RCC CF 
Loader.  There will be no ROM disk available under RomWBW.  There will 
be a RAM Disk and it's initial contents will be seeded by the image 
loaded by the CF Loader.
